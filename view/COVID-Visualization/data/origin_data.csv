a-ldav-1026,"Collaborative exploration of scientific data sets across large high-resolution displays requires both high visual detail as well as low-latency transfer of image data (oftentimes inducing the need to trade one for the other). In this work, we present a system that dynamically adapts the encoding quality in such systems in a way that reduces the required bandwidth without impacting the details perceived by one or more observers. Humans perceive sharp, colourful details, in the small foveal region around the centre of the field of view, while information in the periphery is perceived blurred and colourless. We account for this by tracking the gaze of observers, and respectively adapting the quality parameter of each macroblock used by the H.264 encoder, considering the so-called visual acuity fall-off. This allows to substantially reduce the required bandwidth with barely noticeable changes in visual quality, which is crucial for collaborative analysis across display walls at different locations. We demonstrate the reduced overall required bandwidth and the high quality inside the foveated regions using particle rendering and parallel coordinates.","Florian Frieß,Matthias Braun,Valentin Bruder,Steffen Frey,Guido Reina,Thomas Ertl",a-ldav-1026,Best Paper: Foveated Encoding for Large High-Resolution Displays
a-beliv-8301,"We reflect on our experiences as designers of COVID-19 data visu- alizations working in a distributed synchronous design space during the pandemic. This is especially relevant as the pandemic posed new challenges to distributed collaboration amidst civic lock down mea- sures and an increased dependency on spatially distributed teamwork across sectors. As a response to the barriers of working from home being 'the new normal', our team used various synchronous remote design tools and methods with an aim to preserve the richness of co-located collaboration such as face-to-face physical presence with the ability to view real-time body gestures, facial expressions, and the making and sharing of physical artifacts. Since members of our cross-disciplinary team had different technological skills, we explored potential solutions for collaborating and prototyping re- motely using tools at home. Practicing real-time sketching on paper and digitally while meeting over Zoom, Miro, and Google Docs, we cultivated an awareness and spontaneity of collective design activi- ties and idea sharing based on our experiences of co-located design. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, we articulate our experiences through challenges and opportunities throughout the process that may provide useful insights about enabling a more fluid distributed collaboration.","Tatiana Losev,Sarah Storteboom,Sheelagh Carpendale,Søren Knudsen",a-beliv-8301,Distributed Visualization Design: Challenges and Opportunities
a-beliv-3678,"Among the many changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most pressing for scientific research concerns user testing. For the researchers who conduct studies with human participants, the requirements for social distancing have created a need for reflecting on methodologies that previously seemed relatively straightforward. It has become clear from the emerging literature on the topic and from first-hand experiences of researchers that the restrictions due to the pandemic affect every aspect of the research pipeline. The current paper offers an initial reflection on user-based research, drawing on the authors' own experiences and on the results of a survey that was conducted among researchers in different disciplines, primarily psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization communities. While this sampling of researchers is by no means comprehensive, the multi-disciplinary approach and the consideration of different aspects of the research pipeline allow us to examine current and future challenges for user-based research. Through an exploration of these issues, this paper also invites others in the VIS--as well as in the wider--research community, to reflect on and discuss the ways in which the current crisis might also present new and previously unexplored opportunities.","Priscilla Balestrucci,Katrin Angerbauer,Cristina Morariu,Robin Welsch,Lewis L Chuang,Daniel Weiskopf,Marc Ernst,Michael Sedlmair",a-beliv-3678,"Pipelines Bent, Pipelines Broken: Interdisciplinary Self-Reflection on the Impact of COVID-19 on Current and Future Research"
a-ldav-1016,"The use of adaptive workflow management for in situ visualization and analysis has been a growing trend in large-scale scientific simulations. However, coordinating adaptive workflows with traditional procedural programming languages can be difficult because systemflow is determined by unpredictable scientific phenomena, which often appear in an unknown order and can evade event handling. This makes the implementation of adaptive workflows tedious and error-prone. Recently, reactive and declarative programming paradigms have been recognized as well-suited solutions to similar problems in other domains. However, there is a dearth of research on adapting these approaches to in situ visualization and analysis. With this paper, we present a language design and runtime system for developing adaptive systems through a declarative and reactive programming paradigm. We illustrate how an adaptive workflow programming system is implemented using our approach and demonstrate it with a use case from a combustion simulation.","Qi Wu,Tyson Neuroth,Oleg Igouchkine,Aditya Konduri,Jacqueline Chen,Kwan-Liu Ma",a-ldav-1016,DIVA: A Declarative and Reactive Language for In Situ Visualization
a-ldav-1022,"The contour tree is a tool for understanding the topological structure of a scalar field. Recent work has built efficient contour tree algorithms for shared memory parallel computation, driven by the need to analyze large data sets in situ while the simulation is running. Unfortunately, methods for using the contour tree for practical data analysis are still primarily serial, including single isocontour extraction, branch decomposition and simplification. We report data parallel methods for these tasks using a data structure called the hyperstructure and a general purpose approach called a hypersweep. We implement and integrate these methods with a Cinema database that stores features as depth images and with a web server that reconstructs the features for direct visualization.","Petar Hristov,Gunther Weber,Hamish Carr,Oliver Rübel,James Ahrens",a-ldav-1022,Data Parallel Hypersweeps for In Situ Topological Analysis
a-ldav-1013,"This short paper compares the time-to-solution for in-line and in-transit in situ visualization, analyzing when one paradigm is faster than another. To perform this comparison, we create a corpus of data by running a scaling study using two common visualization algorithms (isosurfacing and volume rendering), with in-line and in- transit. Our experiments vary an array of parameters, including the size of the in-transit in situ allocation, the simulation cycle time, and the scale of the simulation (up to 32,768 cores and 64 billion total cells). We then analyze this corpus of data and draw conclusions about when each paradigm is the fastest. Our findings show that in-transit is faster than in-line when inter-process communication was high (up to 35% more efficient) and when our computation-bound algorithm was run at large scale (up to 47% more efficient). On the other hand, in-line was faster with our computation-bound algorithm and a short simulation cycle time (up to 42% more efficient). Finally, this work informs future directions for understanding other classes of in situ visualization algorithms.","James Kress,Matthew Larsen,Jong Choi,Mark Kim,Mathew Wolf,Norbert Podhorszki,Scott Klasky,Hank Childs,David Pugmire",a-ldav-1013,Comparing Time-to-Solution for In Situ Visualization Paradigms at Scale
a-beliv-8820,"Understanding a visualization is a multi-level process. A reader must extract and extrapolate from numeric facts, understand how those facts apply to both the context of the data and other potential contexts, and draw or evaluate conclusions from the data. A well-designed visualization should support each of these levels of understanding. We diagnose levels of understanding of visualized data by adapting Bloom's taxonomy, a common framework from the education literature. We describe each level of the framework and provide examples for how it can be applied to evaluate the efficacy of data visualizations along six levels of knowledge acquisition - knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. We present three case studies showing that this framework expands on existing methods to comprehensively measure how a visualization design facilitates a viewer's understanding of visualizations. Although Bloom's original taxonomy suggests a strong hierarchical structure for some domains, we found few examples of dependent relationships between performance at different levels for our three case studies. If this level-independence holds across new tested visualizations, the taxonomy could serve to inspire more targeted evaluations of levels of understanding that are relevant to a communication goal.","Alyxander Burns,Cindy Xiong,Steven Franconeri,Alberto Cairo,Narges Mahyar",a-beliv-8820,How to evaluate data visualizations across different levels of understanding
a-beliv-6687,"Visualization research and practice that incorporates the arts make claims to being more effective in connecting with users on a human level. However, these claims are difficult to measure quantitatively. In this paper, we present a follow-on study to use close reading, a humanities method from literary studies, to evaluate visualizations created using artistic processes [Bares 2020]. Close reading is a method in literary studies that we've previously explored as a method for evaluating visualizations. To use close reading as an evaluation method, we guide participants through a series of steps designed to prompt them to interpret the visualization's formal, informational, and contextual features. Here we elaborate on our motivations for using close reading as a method to evaluate visualizations, and enumerate the procedures we used in the study to evaluate a 2D visualization, including modifications made because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key findings of this study include that close reading is an effective formative method to elicit information related to interpretation and critique; user subject position; and suspicion or skepticism. Information gained through close reading is valuable in the visualization design and iteration processes, both related to designing features and other formal elements more effectively, as well as in considering larger questions of context and framing.","Annie Bares,Stephanie Zeller,Cullen D.

a-beliv-5851,"Many interactive data systems combine visual representations of data with embedded algorithmic support for automation and data exploration. To effectively support transparent and explainable data systems, it is important for researchers and designers to know how users understand the system. We discuss the evaluation of users' mental models of system logic. Mental models are challenging to capture and analyze. While common evaluation methods aim to approximate the user's final mental model after a period of system usage, user understanding continuously evolves as users interact with a system over time. In this paper, we review many common mental model measurement techniques, discuss tradeoffs, and recommend methods for deeper, more meaningful evaluation of mental models when using interactive data analysis and visualization systems. We present guidelines for evaluating mental models over time to allow for assessment of the evolution of specific model updates and mapping to particular use of interface features and data queries. By asking users to describe what they know and how they know it, researchers can collect structured, time-ordered insight into a user's conceptualization process while also helping guide users to their own discoveries.","Jeremy E Block,Eric Ragan",a-beliv-5851,Micro-entries: Encouraging Deeper Evaluation of Mental Models Over Time for Interactive Data Systems
a-ldav-1012,"Information visualization applications have become ubiquitous, in no small part thanks to the ease of wide distribution and deployment to users enabled by the web browser. Scientific visualization applications, relying on native code libraries and parallel processing, have been less suited to such widespread distribution, as browsers do not provide the required libraries or compute capabilities. In this paper, we revisit this gap in visualization technologies and explore how new web technologies, WebAssembly and WebGPU, can be used to deploy powerful visualization solutions for large-scale scientific data in the browser. In particular, we evaluate the programming effort required to bring scientific visualization applications to the browser through these technologies and assess their competitiveness against classic native solutions. As a main example, we present a new GPU-driven isosurface extraction method for block-compressed data sets, that is suitable for interactive isosurface computation on large volumes in resource-constrained environments, such as the browser. We conclude that web browsers are on the verge of becoming a competitive platform for even the most demanding scientific visualization tasks, such as interactive visualization of isosurfaces from a 1TB DNS simulation. We call on researchers and developers to consider investing in a community software stack to ease use of these upcoming browser features to bring accessible scientific visualization to the browser.","Will Usher,Valerio Pascucci",a-ldav-1012,Interactive Visualization of Terascale Data in the Browser: Fact or Fiction?
a-ldav-1024,"This paper presents a framework that fully leverages the advantages of a deferred rendering approach for the interactive visualization of large-scale datasets. Geometry buffers (G-Buffers) are generated and stored in situ, and shading is performed post hoc in an interactive image-based rendering front end. This decoupled framework has two major advantages.First, the G-Buffers only need to be computed and stored once---which corresponds to the most expensive part of the rendering pipeline.Second, the stored G-Buffers can later be consumed in an image-based rendering front end that enables users to interactively adjust various visualization parameters---such as the applied color map or the strength of ambient occlusion---where suitable choices are often not known a priori.This paper demonstrates the use of Cinema Darkroom on several real-world datasets, highlighting CD's ability to effectively decouple the complexity and size of the dataset from its visualization.","Jonas Lukasczyk,Christoph Garth,Matthew Larsen,Wito Engelke,Ingrid Hotz,David Rogers,James Ahrens,Ross Maciejewski",a-ldav-1024,Cinema Darkroom: A Deferred Rendering Framework for Large-Scale Datasets
a-ldav-1019,"3D particle data is relevant for a wide range of scientific domains, from molecular dynamics to astrophysics. Simulations in these domains can produce datasets containing millions or billions of particles and rendering needs to be in high quality and interactive to support the scientists in exploring and understanding the structure of their data. One general baseline approach is to represent particles as spheres and employ ray tracing as a rendering technique. However, ray tracing requires the data to be organized in acceleration data structures like bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) to achieve interactive frame rates. Modern GPUs provide hardware acceleration for traversing such data structures but are more limited in memory than CPUs. In this paper, we evaluate different acceleration data structures for sphere-based datasets, including particle kD trees, with respect to their scalability regarding both memory size and speed, and we analyze how these data structures can benefit from hardware acceleration. We show that a bricking of data results in the most effective BVH, both fast to traverse utilizing hardware acceleration and with a reasonably small memory footprint. Additionally, we present a hybrid acceleration data structure that has negligible memory overhead and still ensures reasonable traversal speed. Based on our results, visualization tools and APIs for the ray tracing can provide overall better performance by adapting to the needs of particle-centric application scenarios.","Patrick Gralka,Ingo Wald,Sergej Geringer,Guido Reina,Thomas Ertl",a-ldav-1019,Spatial Partitioning Strategies for Memory-Efficient Ray Tracing of Particles
a-beliv-8994,"We often point to the relative increase in the amount and sophistication of evaluations of visualization systems versus the earliest days of the field as evidence that we are maturing as a field. I am not so convinced. In particular, I feel that evaluations of visualizations, as they are ordinarily performed in the field or asked for by reviewers, fail to tell us very much that is useful or transferable about visualization systems, regardless of the statistical rigor or ecological validity of the evaluation. Through a series of thought experiments, I show how our current conceptions of visualization evaluations can be incomplete, capricious, or useless for the goal of furthering the field, more in line with the ""heroic age"" of medical science than the rigorous evidence-based field we might aspire to be.

However, beyond popular beliefs, there have been few attempts to empirically demonstrate whether adding interaction to a static visualization improves its function. In this paper, we address this gap. We use a classic Bayesian reasoning task as a test bed for evaluating whether allowing users to interact with a static visualization can improve their reasoning. Through a crowdsourced study, we show that adding interaction to a static Bayesian reasoning visualization does not necessarily improve users' accuracy on a Bayesian reasoning task, and in some cases can significantly detract from it. Moreover, we demonstrate that changes in performance are modulated by the design of the underlying visualization, and users' spatial ability. Our work suggests that interaction is not as unambiguously good as we often believe.","Ab Mosca,Alvitta Ottley,Remco Chang",w-comm-1018,Does Interaction Improve Bayesian Reasoning with Visualization?

Our goal was to determine whether these other plot types would produce fewer biases in interpretation relative to bar plots. Scientists who have experience generating and interpreting statistical graphs used plots to assess whether the difference between two datasets was statistically significant. Our results replicated the patterns of biases that have been observed in prior studies of error bar interpretation.

People were bombarded with a wide set of public health visualizations ranging from simple graphs to complex interactive dashboards.

When evaluating visualizations aimed towards the general public with vastly different socio-demographic backgrounds and varying levels of technical savviness and data literacy, it is important to understand user feedback beyond aspects such as speed, task accuracy, or usability problems.

We refer to those locations as disputed areas, as there is tension and uncertainty on ownership, which is an important spatial analysis tool, e. g., in sports where players share a space with adversaries. We present the process to calculate those disputed areas from existing space ownership models, and introduce several visualizations and analysis of those areas using sport tracking data from Liverpool 2019’s goals. Those areas have been particularly insightful to understand assists, the ultimate pass that is critical for a team to score.

f-vast-1307,"Traffic light detection is crucial for environment perception and decision-making in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art detectors are built upon deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and have exhibited promising performance. However, one looming concern with CNN based detectors is how to thoroughly evaluate the performance of accuracy and robustness before they can be deployed to autonomous vehicles. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system, VATLD, equipped with a disentangled representation learning and semantic adversarial learning, to assess, understand, and improve the accuracy and robustness of traffic light detectors in autonomous driving applications. The disentangled representation learning extracts data semantics to augment human cognition with human-friendly visual summarization, and the semantic adversarial learning efficiently exposes the interpretable robustness risks and enables minimal human interaction for actionable insights. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of various performance improvement strategies derived from actionable insights with our visual analytics system, VATLD, and illustrate the practical implications for safety-critical applications in autonomous driving.","Liang Gou,Lincan Zou,Nanxiang Li,Michael Hofmann,Shekar Arvind Kumar,Axel Wendt,Liu Ren",f-vast-1307,"VATLD: A Visual Analytics System to Assess, Understand and Improve Traffic Light Detection"
f-info-1187,"Uncertainty visualizations often emphasize point estimates to support magnitude estimates or decisions through visual comparison. However, when design choices emphasize means, users may overlook uncertainty information and misinterpret visual distance as a proxy for effect size. We present findings from a mixed design experiment on Mechanical Turk which tests eight uncertainty visualization designs: 95% containment intervals, hypothetical outcome plots, densities, and quantile dotplots, each with and without means added. We find that adding means to uncertainty visualizations has small biasing effects on both magnitude estimation and decision-making, consistent with discounting uncertainty. We also see that visualization designs that support the least biased effect size estimation do not support the best decision-making, suggesting that a chart user's sense of effect size may not necessarily be identical when they use the same information for different tasks. In a qualitative analysis of users' strategy descriptions, we find that many users switch strategies and do not employ an optimal strategy when one exists. Uncertainty visualizations which are optimally designed in theory may not be the most effective in practice because of the ways that users satisfice with heuristics, suggesting opportunities to better understand visualization effectiveness by modeling sets of potential strategies.","Alex Kale,Matthew Kay,Jessica Hullman",f-info-1187,Visual Reasoning Strategies for Effect Size Judgments and Decisions
f-scivis-1144,"Computing and visualizing features in fluid flow often depends on the observer, or reference frame, relative to which the input velocity field is given. A desired property of feature detectors is therefore that they are objective, meaning independent of the input reference frame. However, the standard definition of objectivity is only given for Euclidean domains, and cannot be applied in curved spaces. We build on methods from mathematical physics and Riemannian geometry to generalize objectivity to curved spaces, using the powerful notion of symmetry groups as the basis for defining objectivity. From this, we develop a general mathematical framework for computing objective observer fields for curved surfaces, relative to which other computed measures become objective. An important property of our framework is that it works intrinsically in 2D, instead of in the 3D ambient space. This enables a direct generalization of the 2D computation of observer fields via optimization from flat domains to curved domains, without having to perform optimization in 3D. We specifically develop the case of unsteady 2D geophysical flows given on spheres, such as the Earth. Observer fields on curved surfaces enable objective feature computation as well as the visualization of the time evolution of scalar and vector fields, such that the automatically computed reference frames follow moving structures like vortices in a way that makes them appear to be steady.","Peter Rautek,Matej Mlejnek,Johanna Beyer,Jakob Troidl,Hanspeter Pfister,Thomas Theussl,Markus Hadwiger",f-scivis-1144,Objective Observer-Relative Flow Visualization in Curved Spaces for Unsteady 2D Geophysical Flows

However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines.

f-info-1051,"Recent graphical interfaces offer direct manipulation mechanisms for authoring visualizations, but are largely restricted to static output. To author interactive visualizations, users must instead turn to textual specification, but such approaches impose a higher technical burden. To bridge this gap, we introduce Lyra 2, a system that extends a prior visualization design environment with novel methods for authoring interaction techniques by demonstration. Users perform an interaction (e.g., button clicks, drags, or key presses) directly on the visualization they are editing. The system interprets this performance using a set of heuristics and enumerates suggestions of possible interaction designs. These heuristics account for the properties of the interaction (e.g., target and event type) as well as the visualization (e.g., mark and scale types, and multiple views). Interaction design suggestions are displayed as thumbnails; users can preview and test these suggestions, iteratively refine them through additional demonstrations, and finally apply and customize them via property inspectors. We evaluate our approach through a gallery of diverse examples, and evaluate its usability through a first-use study and via an analysis of its cognitive dimensions.

These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints.

The designed model considers the salient features of visualization images to reduce the explicit visual loss caused by encoding. To further support large-scale encoding and decoding, we consider the characteristics of information visualization and propose a saliency-based QR code layout algorithm.

For example, changing the chart style or type or a data value in a chart image practically requires re-creating a new chart completely, which is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. To assist these tasks, many approaches have been proposed to automatically extract information from chart images with computer vision and machine learning techniques. Although they have achieved promising preliminary results, there are still a lot of challenges to overcome in terms of robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative approach called Chartem to address this issue directly from the root. Specifically, we design a data embedding schema to encode a significant amount of information into the background of a chart image without interfering human perception of the chart. The embedded information, when extracted from the image, can enable a variety of visualization applications to reuse or repurpose chart images. To evaluate the effectiveness of Chartem, we conduct a user study and performance experiments on Chartem embedding and extraction algorithms.

Users have to choose between the two extremes of (i) sharing non-interactive dataless formats such as images and videos, or (ii) giving access to their data and software to others with no control over how the data will be used. In this work, we fill the gap between the two extremes and present a new system, called Loom. Loom captures interactive visualizations as standalone dataless objects. Users can interact with Loom objects as if they still have the original software and data that created those visualizations. Yet, Loom objects are completely independent and can therefore be shared online without requiring the data or the visualization software. Loom objects are efficient to store and use, and provide privacy preserving mechanisms.

In response, the toolkit returns an analytic specification modeled as a JSON object containing data attributes, analytic tasks, and a list of Vega-Lite specifications relevant to the input query. In doing so, NL4DV aids visualization developers who may not have a background in NLP, enabling them to create new visualization NLIs or incorporate natural language input within their existing systems.

f-info-1015,"Static scatterplots often suffer from the overdraw problem on big datasets where object overlap causes undesirable visual clutter. The use of zooming in scatterplots can help alleviate this problem. With multiple zoom levels, more screen real estate is available, allowing objects to be placed in a less crowded way. We call this type of visualization scalable scatterplot visualizations, or SSV for short. Despite the potential of SSVs, existing systems and toolkits fall short in supporting the authoring of SSVs due to three limitations. First, many systems have limited scalability, assuming that data fits in the memory of one computer. Second, too much developer work, e.g., using custom code to generate mark layouts or render objects, is required. Third, many systems focus on only a small subset of the SSV design space (e.g. supporting a specific type of visual marks). To address these limitations, we have developed Kyrix-S, a system for easy authoring of SSVs at scale. Kyrix-S derives a declarative grammar that enables specification of a variety of SSVs in a few tens of lines of code, based on an existing survey of scatterplot tasks and designs. The declarative grammar is supported by a distributed layout algorithm which automatically places visual marks onto zoom levels. We store data in a multi-node database and use multi-node spatial indexes to achieve interactive browsing of large SSVs. Extensive experiments show that 1) Kyrix-S enables interactive browsing of SSVs of billions of objects, with response times under 500ms and 2) Kyrix-S achieves 4X-9X reduction in specification compared to a state-of-the-art authoring system.","Wenbo Tao,Xinli Hou,Adam Sah,Leilani Battle,Remco Chang,Michael Stonebraker",f-info-1015,Kyrix-S: Authoring Scalable Scatterplot Visualizations of Big Data
f-info-1119,"To interpret information visualizations, observers must determine how visual features map onto concepts. First and foremost this ability depends on perceptual discriminability; e.g., observers must be able to see the difference between different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings. However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminabilty, the degree to which observers can differentiate which visual features map to each concept in the encoding system without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels. Previous evidence suggested that semantic discriminability was higher for a color-coding system that maximized semantic distance (maximizing association strength between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts), compared with a system that maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic distance also resulted in increased perceptual distance so it is unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was chosen to be large enough to ensure colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.","Karen Schloss,Zachary Leggon,Laurent Lessard",f-info-1119,Semantic Discriminability for Visual Communication
f-info-1036,"Color mapping is a foundational technique for visualizing scalar data. Prior literature offers guidelines for effective colormap design, such as emphasizing luminance variation while limiting changes in hue. However, empirical studies of color are largely focused on perceptual tasks. This narrow focus inhibits our understanding of how generalizable these guidelines are, particularly to tasks like visual inference that require synthesis and judgement across multiple percepts. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional ramp designs (e.g., sequential or diverging) may sideline other key metrics or design strategies. We study how a cognitive metric---color name variation---impacts people's ability to make model-based judgments. In two graphical inference experiments, participants saw a series of color-coded scalar fields sampled from different models and assessed the relationships between these models. Contrary to conventional guidelines, participants were more accurate when viewing colormaps that cross a variety of uniquely nameable colors. We modeled participants' performance using this metric and found that it provides a better fit to the experimental data than do existing design principles. Our findings indicate cognitive advantages for colorful maps like rainbow, which exhibit high color categorization, despite their traditionally undesirable perceptual properties. We also found no evidence that color categorization would lead observers to infer false data features. Our results provide empirically grounded metrics for predicting a colormap's performance and suggest alternative guidelines for designing new quantitative colormaps to support inference.

In this paper, we propose to establish a test suite for evaluating the design of colormaps. With such a suite, the users can observe the effects when different continuous colormaps are applied to planar scalar fields that may exhibit various characteristic features, such as jumps, local extrema, ridge or valley lines, different distributions of scalar values, different gradients, different signal frequencies, different levels of noise, and so on. The suite also includes an expansible collection of real-world data sets including the most popular data for colormap testing in the visualization literature.

f-info-1014,"Bar charts are among the most frequently used visualizations, in part because their position encoding leads them to convey data values precisely. Yet reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased. Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3 confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that might be prone to this bias beyond bar graphs (e.g., Mekko charts and treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases toward prototypical values.","Cristina Ceja,Caitlyn McColeman,Cindy Xiong,Steven Franconeri",f-info-1014,Truth or Square: Aspect Ratio Biases Recall of Position Encodings
f-info-1103,"Data visualization is powerful in large part because it facilitates visual extraction of values. Yet, existing measures of perceptual precision for data channels (e.g., position, length, orientation, etc.) are based largely on verbal reports of ratio judgments between two values (e.g., Cleveland & McGill 1984). Verbal report conflates multiple sources of error beyond actual visual precision, introducing a ratio computation between these values and a requirement to translate that ratio to a verbal number. Here we observe raw measures of precision by eliminating both ratio computations and verbal reports; we simply ask participants to reproduce marks (a single bar or dot) to match a previously seen one. We manipulated whether the mark was initially presented (and later drawn) alone, paired with a reference (e.g. a second '100%' bar also present at test, or a y-axis for the dot), or integrated with the reference (merging that reference bar into a stacked bar graph, or placing the dot directly on the axis). Reproductions of smaller values were overestimated, and larger values were underestimated, suggesting systematic memory biases. Average reproduction error was around 10% of the actual value, regardless of whether the reproduction was done on a common baseline with the original. In the reference and (especially) the integrated conditions, responses were repulsed from an implicit midpoint of the reference mark, such that values above 50% were overestimated, and values below 50% were underestimated. This reproduction paradigm may serve within a new suite of more fundamental measures of the precision of graphical perception.","Caitlyn McColeman,Mi Feng,Lane Harrison,Steven Franconeri",f-info-1103,No mark is an island: Precision and category repulsion biases in data reproductions
f-info-1225,"Data visualizations convert numbers into visual marks so that our visual system can extract data from an image instead of raw numbers. Clearly, the visual system does not compute these values as a computer would, e.g., by calculating an arithmetic mean or a correlation. Instead, it extracts these patterns using perceptual proxies; heuristic shortcuts of the visual marks, such as a center of mass or a shape envelope. Understanding which proxies people actually use would lead to more effective visualizations. We present the results of a series of crowdsourced experiments that measure how powerfully a set of candidate proxies can explain human performance when comparing the mean and range of pairs of data series presented as bar charts. We generated datasets where the correct answer—the series with the higher arithmetic mean or range—was pitted against an “adversarial” series that should be seen as higher if the viewer uses a particular candidate proxy. Using a staircase design, we sought metrics of how strongly each adversarial proxy could drive viewers to answer incorrectly, yielding evidence for whether that proxy is consistent with the viewer's actual practice. We then use hierarchical modeling to investigate whether different individuals may choose different proxies.

While a variety of automated methods have been developed to identify when concept drift occurs, there is limited support for analysts who need to understand and correct their models when drift is detected. In this paper, we present a visual analytics method, DriftVis, to support model builders and analysts in the identification and correction of concept drift in streaming data. DriftVis combines a distribution-based drift detection method with a streaming scatterplot to support the analysis of drift caused by the distribution changes of data streams and to explore the impact of these changes on the model's accuracy. A quantitative experiment and two case studies on weather prediction and text classification have been conducted to demonstrate our proposed tool and illustrate how visual analytics can be used to support the detection, examination, and correction of concept drift.","Weikai Yang,Zhen Li,Mengchen Liu,Yafeng Lu,Kelei Cao,Ross Maciejewski,Shixia Liu",f-vast-1087,Diagnosing Concept Drift with Visual Analytics

s-short-1052,"We study uncertainty in the dynamics of time-dependent flows by identifying barriers and enhancers to stochastic transport. This topological segmentation is closely related to the theory of Lagrangian coherent structures and is based on a recently introduced quantity, the diffusion barrier strength (DBS). The DBS is defined similar to the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE), but incorporates diffusion during flow integration. Height ridges of the DBS indicate stochastic transport barriers and enhancers, i.e. material surfaces that are minimally or maximally diffusive. To apply these concepts to real-world data, we represent uncertainty in a flow by a stochastic differential equation that consists of a deterministic and a stochastic component modeled by a Gaussian. With this formulation we identify barriers and enhancers to stochastic transport, without performing expensive Monte Carlo simulation and with a computational complexity comparable to FTLE. In addition, we propose a complementary visualization to convey the absolute scale of uncertainties in the Lagrangian frame of reference. This enables us to study uncertainty in real-world datasets, for example due to small deviations, data reduction, or estimated from multiple ensemble runs.","Tobias Rapp,Carsten Dachsbacher",s-short-1052,Uncertain Transport in Unsteady Flows

Much work has centered around converting triangle meshes to sparse voxel octrees (SVOs) and developing memory efficient storage schemes but little exploration of the implications to scientific visualization has taken place. In this work we explore techniques for high-performance rendering of tubes, such as streamtubes used for visualizing vector fields and fiber tracts from diffusion tensor MRI. We first present our method for generating a voxelization of the tubes, and then describe several methods for rendering: raytracing a SVO storing straight tube segments in the leaves, and hybrid raytracing/raycasting a SVO storing curved tube segments. We discuss the tradeoffs inherent in these different representations and compare the rendering techniques and results.

To reduce the storage footprint and facilitate scalable post-hoc analyses of such scientific data sets, various data reduction/summarization methods have been proposed over the years. Different flavors of sampling algorithms exist to sample the high-resolution scientific data, while preserving important data properties required for subsequent analyses. However, most of these sampling algorithms are designed for univariate data and cater to post-hoc analyses of single variables. In this work, we propose a multivariate sampling strategy which preserves the original variable relationships and enables different multivariate analyses directly on the sampled data. Our proposed strategy utilizes principal component analysis to capture the variance of multivariate data and can be built on top of any existing state-of-the-art sampling algorithms for single variables. In addition, we also propose variants of different data partitioning schemes (regular and irregular) to efficiently model the local multivariate relationships. Using two real-world multivariate data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed multivariate sampling strategy with respect to its data reduction capabilities as well as the ease of performing efficient post-hoc multivariate analyses.","Subhashis Hazarika,Ayan Biswas,Philip Wolfram,Earl Lawrence,Nathan Urban",s-short-1176,Relationship-aware Multivariate Sampling Strategy for Scientific Simulation Data

These brain regions are typically represented by atlases that capture general trends over large populations.

In this work, we present an interactive visualization method, PRAGMA, that allows domain experts to derive scan-specific parcellations from established atlases. PRAGMA features a user-driven, hierarchical clustering scheme for defining temporally correlated parcels in varying granularity. The visualization design supports the user in making decisions on how to perform clustering, namely when to expand, collapse, or merge parcels. This is accomplished through a set of linked and coordinated views for understanding the user's current hierarchy, assessing intra-cluster variation, and relating parcellations to an established atlas. We assess the effectiveness of PRAGMA through a user study with four neuroimaging domain experts, where our results show that PRAGMA shows the potential to enable exploration of individualized and state-specific brain parcellations and to offer interesting insights into functional brain networks.","Roza Gunes Bayrak,Nhung Hoang,Colin Blake Hansen,Catie Chang,Matthew Berger",s-short-1166,PRAGMA: Interactively Constructing Functional Brain Parcellations

Subsets of essays can be selected and analyzed in detail using the Argument Unit Occurrence Tree which aggregates the argument structures using hierarchical histograms. This hierarchical view facilitates the estimation of statistics and trends concerning the progression of the argumentation in the essays. It also provides insights into the commonalities and differences between selected subsets. The text view is the necessary textual basis to verify conclusions from the other views and the annotation process. Linking the views and interaction techniques for visual filtering, studying the evolution of stance within a subset of essays and scrutinizing the order of argumentative units enable a deep analysis of essay corpora.

However, this has limitations when the algorithms cannot be easily adapted to changes, and it is difficult to realize interactivity closely supported by underlying algorithms. Instead, we emphasize the concept of tight integration, which advocates for the need to co-develop interactive algorithms and interactive visual analytic systems in parallel to allow flexibility and scalability.

In these years, the north of the majority of the researchers had been to improve quality metrics, notwithstanding the lack of information about models' decisions such metrics convey.

Part of this trend, visualization techniques have been extensively used to support the interpretability of classification models, with a significant focus on rule-based techniques.  Despite the advances, the existing approaches present limitations in terms of visual scalability, and the visualization of large and complex models, such as the ones produced by the Random Forest (RF) technique, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Explainable Matrix (ExMatrix), a novel visualization method for RF interpretability that can handle models with massive quantities of rules. It employs a simple yet powerful matrix-like visual metaphor, where rows are rules, columns are features, and cells are rules predicates, enabling the analysis of entire models and auditing classification results.

However, such projection-based analyses are limited due to their lack of ability to show separations in complex non-linear decision boundary structures and can suffer from heavy distortion and low interpretability. To overcome these issues of separability and interpretability,} we propose a visual analysis approach that utilizes the power of explainability from linear projections to support analysts when exploring non-linear separation structures. Our approach is to extract a set of locally linear segments that approximate the original non-linear separations.

Furthermore, they do not scale for large and complex Git commit graphs, which can play an important role in understanding the overall development history.

Each robot in a multi-robot system that uses the shared-world coordination paradigm autonomously schedules which robot should perform a given task, and when, using its worldview–the robot's internal representation of its belief about both its own state, and other robots' states. A key problem for operators is that robots' worldviews can fall out of sync (often due to weak communication links), leading to desynchronization of the robots' scheduling decisions and inconsistent emergent behavior (e.g., tasks not performed, or performed by multiple robots). Operators face the time-consuming and difficult task of making sense of the robots' scheduling decisions, detecting de-synchronizations, and pinpointing the cause by comparing every robot's worldview. To address these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC Viewer, a visual analytics system that helps operators (i) make sense of the robots' schedules and (ii) detect and conduct a root cause analysis of the robots' desynchronized worldviews.

s-short-1062,"With the wide applications of algorithmic trading, it has become critical for traders to build a winning trading algorithm to beat the market. However, due to the lack of efficient tools, traders mainly rely on their memory to manually compare the algorithm instances of a trading algorithm and further select the best trading algorithm instance for the real trading deployment. We work closely with industry practitioners to discover and consolidate user requirements and develop an interactive visual analytics system for trading algorithm optimization. Structured expert interviews are conducted to evaluate TradAO and a representative case study is documented for illustrating the system effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, previous financial data visual analyses have mainly aimed to assist investment managers in investment portfolio analysis but have neglected the need of traders in developing trading algorithms for portfolio execution. TradAO is the first visual analytics system that assists users in comprehensively exploring the performances of a trading algorithm with different parameter settings.","Ka Wing Tsang,Haotian Li,Fuk Ming Lam,Yifan Mu,Yong Wang,Huamin Qu",s-short-1062,TradAO: A Visual Analytics System for Trading Algorithm Optimization
s-short-1136,"When visualizing data in a realistically rendered 3D virtual environment, it is often important to represent not only the 3D scene but also overlaid information about additional, abstract data. These overlays must be usefully visible, i.e. be readable enough to convey the information they represent, but remain unobtrusive to avoid cluttering the view. We take a step toward establishing guidelines for designing such overlays by studying the relationship between three different patterns (filled, striped and dotted patterns), two pattern densities, the presence or not of a solid outline, two types of background (blank and with trees), and the opacity of the overlay. For each combination of factors, participants set the faintest and the strongest acceptable opacity values. Results from this first study suggest that i) ranges of acceptable opacities are around 20-70%, that ii) ranges can be extended by 5% by using an outline, and that iii) ranges shift based on features like pattern and density.","Jan Niklas Hombeck,LI JI,Kai Lawonn,Charles Perin",s-short-1136,A Study of Opacity Ranges for Transparent Overlays in 3D Landscapes

s-short-1162,"Ambiguity, an information state where multiple interpretations are plausible, is a common challenge in visual analytics (VA) systems. We discuss lessons learned from a case study designing VA tools for Canadian avalanche forecasters. Avalanche forecasting is a complex and collaborative risk-based decision-making and analysis domain, demanding experience and knowledge-based interpretation of human reported and uncertain data. Differences in reporting practices, organizational contexts, and the particularities of individual reports result in a variety of potential interpretations that have to be negotiated as part of the forecaster's sensemaking processes. We describe our preliminary research using glyphs to support sensemaking under ambiguity. Ambiguity is not unique to public avalanche forecasting. There are many other domains where the way data are measured and reported vary in ways not accounted explicitly in the data, and require analysts to negotiate multiple potential meanings. We argue that ambiguity is under-served by visualization research and would benefit from more explicit VA support.","Stan Nowak,Lyn Bartram,Pascal Haegeli",s-short-1162,Designing for Ambiguity: Visual Analytics in Avalanche Forecasting

f-info-1223,"We present ShuttleSpace, an immersive analytics system to assist experts in analyzing trajectory data in badminton. Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (\emph{e.g.}, how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (\emph{e.g.}, how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace, an immersive analytics system tailored for VR environments. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights. We further conduct interviews with the experts whose feedback confirms that our first-person immersive analytics system is suitable and useful for analyzing badminton data.","Shuainan Ye,Zhutian Chen,Xiangtong Chu,Yifan Wang,Siwei Fu,Lejun Shen,Kun Zhou,Yingcai Wu",f-info-1223,ShuttleSpace: Exploring and Analyzing Movement Trajectory in Immersive Visualization
f-vast-1234,"With the rapid development of online education in recent years, there has been an increasing number of learning platforms that provide students with multi-step questions to cultivate their problem-solving skills. To guarantee the high quality of such learning materials, question designers need to inspect how students' problem-solving processes unfold step by step to infer whether students' problem-solving logic matches their design intent. They also need to compare the behaviors of different groups (e.g., students from different grades) to distribute questions to students with the right level of knowledge. The availability of fine-grained interaction data, such as mouse movement trajectories from the online platforms, provides the opportunity to analyze problem-solving behaviors. However, it is still challenging to interpret, summarize, and compare the high dimensional problem-solving sequence data. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system, QLens, to help question designers inspect detailed problem-solving trajectories, compare different student groups, distill insights for design improvements.  In particular, QLens models problem-solving behavior as a hybrid state transition graph and visualizes it through a novel glyph-embedded Sankey diagram, which reflects students' problem-solving logic, engagement, and encountered difficulties. We conduct three case studies and three expert interviews to demonstrate the usefulness of QLens on real-world datasets that consist of thousands of problem-solving traces.","Meng Xia,Reshika Palaniyappan Velumani,Yong Wang,Huamin Qu,Xiaojuan Ma",f-vast-1234,QLens: Visual Analytics of Multi-step Problem-solving Behaviors for Improving Question Design

Visilant aims to support namely the exploratory part of the investigation pipeline, from case overview, through exploration and hypothesis generation, to the case presentation.

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.","María Virginia Sabando,Pavol Ulbrich,Matias Selzer,Jan Byška,Jan Mičan,Ignacio Ponzoni,Axel Soto,María Luján Ganuza,Barbora Kozlikova",f-scivis-1080,ChemVA: Interactive Visual Analysis of Chemical Compound Similarity in Virtual Screening
f-scivis-1119,"Taylor-Couette flow (TCF) is the turbulent fluid motion created between two concentric and independently rotating cylinders. It has been heavily researched in fluid mechanics thanks to the various nonlinear dynamical phenomena that are exhibited in the flow. As many dense coherent structures overlap each other in TCF, it is challenging to isolate and visualize them, especially when the cylinder rotation ratio is changing. Previous approaches rely on 2D cross sections to study TCF due to its simplicity, which cannot provide the complete information of TCF. In the meantime, standard visualization techniques, such as volume rendering/iso-surfacing of certain attributes and the placement of integral curves/surfaces, usually produce cluttered visualization. To address this challenge and to support domain experts in the analysis of TCF, we developed a visualization framework to separate large-scale structures from the dense, small-scale structures and provide an effective visual representation of these structures. Instead of using a single physical attribute as the standard approach which cannot efficiently separate structures in different scales for TCF, we adapt the feature level-set method to combine multiple attributes and use them as a filter to separate large- and small-scale structures. To visualize these structures, we apply the iso-surface extraction on the kernel density estimate of the distance field generated from the feature level-set. The proposed methods successfully reveal 3D large-scale coherent structures of TCF with different control parameter settings, which are difficult to achieve with the conventional methods.","Duong Nguyen,Rodolfo Ostilla Monico,Guoning Chen",f-scivis-1119,A Visualization Framework for Multi-scale Coherent Structures in Taylor-Couette Turbulence

f-vast-1254,"Data-driven problem solving in many real-world applications involves analysis of time-dependent multivariate data, for which dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to uncover the intrinsic structure and features of the data. However, DR is usually applied to a subset of data that is either single-time-point multivariate or univariate time-series, resulting in the need to manually examine and correlate the DR results out of different data subsets. When the number of dimensions is large either in terms of the number of time points or attributes, this manual task becomes too tedious and infeasible. In this paper, we present MulTiDR, a new DR framework that enables processing of time-dependent multivariate data as a whole to provide a comprehensive overview of the data. With the framework, we employ DR in two steps. When treating the instances, time points, and attributes of the data as a 3D array, the first DR step reduces the three axes of the array to two, and the second DR step visualizes the data in a lower-dimensional space. In addition, by coupling with a contrastive learning method and interactive visualizations, our framework enhances analysts' ability to interpret DR results.

For comparing data streams involving multiple items (e.g., words in texts, actors or action types in action sequences, visited places in itineraries, etc.), we propose Co-Bridges, a visual design involving connection and comparison techniques that reveal similarities and differences between two streams. Co-Bridges use river and bridge metaphors, where two sides of a river represent data streams, and bridges connect temporally or sequentially aligned segments of streams. Commonalities and differences between these segments in terms of involvement of various items are shown on the bridges. Interactive query tools support the selection of particular stream subsets for focused exploration. The visualization supports both qualitative (common and distinct items) and quantitative (stream volume, amount of item involvement) comparisons. We further propose Comparison-of-Comparisons, in which two or more Co-Bridges corresponding to different selections are juxtaposed. We test the applicability of the Co-Bridges in different domains, including social media text streams and sports event sequences. We perform an evaluation of the users' capability to understand and use Co-Bridges.

Yet, there is a lack of visual-interactive tools that strongly support such multi-scale segmentation. To close this gap, we present our MultiSegVA platform for interactively defining segmentation techniques and parameters on multiple temporal scales. MultiSegVA primarily contributes tailored, visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms for segmenting unlabeled time series on multiple scales. Further, to flexibly compose the multi-scale segmentation, the platform contributes a new visual query language that links a variety of segmentation techniques. To illustrate our approach, we present a domain-oriented set of segmentation techniques derived in collaboration with movement ecologists. We demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of MultiSegVA in two real-world use cases from movement ecology, related to behavior analysis after environment-aware segmentation, and after progressive clustering. Expert feedback from movement ecologists shows the effectiveness of tailored visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms at segmenting multi-scale data, enabling them to perform semantically meaningful analyses.

Such effects reflect the tendency of humans to take the orthogonal rather than the vertical distance between two curves as their distance. In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

f-tvcg-2019100378,"The visualization of hierarchically structured data over time is an ongoing challenge and several approaches exist trying to solve it. Techniques such as animated or juxtaposed tree visualizations are not capable of providing a good overview of the time series and lack expressiveness in conveying changes over time. Nested streamgraphs provide a better understanding of the data evolution, but lack the clear outline of hierarchical structures at a given timestep. Furthermore, these approaches are often limited to static hierarchies or exclude complex hierarchical changes in the data, limiting their use cases. We propose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all hierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical structure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth transitions between tree maps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration of the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure. As our technique handles topological changes of all types, it is suitable for a wide range of applications.

Our approach is motivated by large molecular models, for which the traditional single-scale navigational metaphors are not suitable. Multi-scale phenomena, e.g., in astronomy or geography, are complex to navigate due to their large data spaces and multi-level organization. Models from structural biology are in addition also densely crowded in space and scale. Cutaways are needed to show individual model subparts. The camera has to support exploration on the level of a whole virus, as well as on the level of a small molecule. We address these challenges by employing HyperLabels: active labels that---in addition to their annotational role---also support user interaction. Clicks on HyperLabels select the next structure to be explored. Then, we adjust the visualization to showcase the inner composition of the selected subpart and enable further exploration. Finally, we use a breadcrumbs panel for orientation and as a mechanism to traverse upwards in the model hierarchy.

There is a variety of different approaches described in theliterature, ranging from chromadepth color coding over depth of field to glyph-based encodings. Unfortunately, the majority of existing approaches suffers from the same problem: As these cues are directly applied to the geometry's surface, the display of additional information on the vessel wall, such as other modalities or derived attributes, is impaired. To overcome this limitation we propose Void Space Surfaces which utilizes empty space in between vessel branches to communicate depth and their relative positioning. This allows us to enhance the depth perception of vascular structures without interfering with the spatial data and potentially superimposed parameter information. With this paper, we introduce Void Space Surfaces, describe their technical realization, and show their application to various vessel trees.

In addition, those DR methods that exist in JavaScript libraries, such as PCA, t-SNE and UMAP, do not offer consistent programming interfaces, hampering the quick integration of different methods. Toward a coherent and comprehensive DR programming framework, we developed an open source JavaScript library named DruidJS. Our library contains implementations of ten different DR algorithms, as well as the required linear algebra techniques, tools, and utilities.","Rene Cutura,Christoph Kralj,Michael Sedlmair",s-short-1132,DRUIDJS - A JavaScript Library for Dimensionality Reduction
s-short-1156,"Provenance tracking is widely acknowledged as an important feature of visualization systems. By tracking provenance data, visualization designers can provide a wide variety of functionality, ranging from action recovery (undo/redo), reproducibility, collaboration and sharing, to logging in support of quantitative and longitudinal evaluation. However, there is currently no widely used library that can provide that functionality. As a consequence, visualization designers either develop ad-hoc solutions that are rarely comprehensive, or don't track provenance at all. In this paper, we introduce a web-based software library – Trrack – that is designed for easy integration in existing or future visualization systems. Trrack supports a wide range of use cases, from simple action recovery, to capturing intent and reasoning, and can be used to share states with collaborators and store provenance on a server. Trrack also includes an optional provenance visualization component that supports annotation of states and aggregation of events.","Zach Cutler,Kiran Gadhave,Alexander Lex",s-short-1156,Trrack: A Library for Provenance Tracking in Web-Based Visualizations

This fruitful collaboration is attracting researchers from other areas of science who may be willing to create visual analysis tools that promote humanities research in its many forms.

To facilitate this task, we have built an introduction to visualization for the digital humanities that sits on a data-driven stance adopted by the authors. In order to construct a dataset representative of the discipline, we analyze citations from a core corpus on 300 publications in visualization for the humanities obtained from recent editions of the InfoVis Vis4DH workshop, the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference, and the specialized digital humanities journal Digital Humanities Quarterly. From here, we extract referenced works and analyze more than 1900 publications in search of citation patterns, prominent authors in the field, and other interesting insights.

f-vast-1216,"An important approach for scientific inquiry across many disciplines involves using observational time series data to understand the relationships between key variables to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying rules that govern the given system. In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.","Hiroaki Natsukawa,Ethan Deyle,Gerald Pao,Koji Koyamada,George Sugihara",f-vast-1216,A Visual Analytics Approach for Ecosystem Dynamics based on Empirical Dynamic Modeling

Third, we visualize the evolving data from a coarse to fine-granular snapshots to semi-automatically analyze temporal states, trends, and outliers. The approach enables us to discover similar temporal summaries (e.g., reoccurring states), reduces the temporal data to speed up automatic analysis, and to explore both structural and temporal properties of a dynamic graph.

f-info-1030,"Dynamic networks can be challenging to analyze visually, especially if they span a large time range during which new nodes and edges can appear and disappear. Although it is straightforward to provide interfaces for visualization that represent multiple states of the network (i.e., multiple timeslices) either simultaneously (e.g., through small multiples) or interactively (e.g., through interactive animation), these interfaces might not support tasks in which disjoint timeslices need to be compared. Since these tasks are key for understanding the dynamic aspects of the network, understanding which interactive visualizations best support these tasks is important. We present the results of a series of laboratory experiments comparing two traditional approaches (small multiples and interactive animation), with a more recent approach based on interactive timeslicing. The tasks were performed on a large display through a touch interface. Participants completed 24 trials of three tasks with all techniques. The results show that interactive timeslicing brings benefit when comparing distant points in time, but less benefits when analyzing contiguous intervals of time.","Alexandra Lee,Daniel Archambault,Miguel Nacenta",f-info-1030,The Effectiveness of Interactive Visualization Techniques for Time Navigation of Dynamic Graphs on Large Displays
f-info-1381,"Dynamic networks—networks that change over time—can be categorized into two types: offline dynamic networks, whereall states of the network are known, and online dynamic networks, where only the past states of the network are known. Research onstaging animated transitions in dynamic networks has focused more on offline data, where rendering strategies can take into accountpast and future states of the network. Rendering online dynamic networks is a more challenging problem since it requires a balancebetween timeliness for monitoring tasks—so that the animations do not lag too far behind the events—and clarity for comprehensiontasks—to minimize simultaneous changes that may be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these requirements,we explore three strategies to stage animations for online dynamic networks: time-based, event-based, and a new hybrid approachthat we introduce by combining the advantages of the first two. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy inrepresenting low- and high-throughput data and conduct a user study involving monitoring and comprehension of dynamic networks.We also conduct a follow-up, think-aloud study combining monitoring and comprehension with experts in dynamic network visualization.Our findings show that animation staging strategies that emphasize comprehension do better for participant response times andaccuracy. However, the notion of “comprehension” is not always clear when it comes to complex changes in highly dynamic networks,requiring some iteration in staging that the hybrid approach affords.

However, the interactive exploration and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge. We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. In particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models. To eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content.

f-vast-1186,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated extraordinarily good performance in many computer vision tasks. The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the importance criteria for pruning, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans.

Representative design problems illustrates how spacecraft path planners can leverage our topology visualization to fully exploit the natural dynamics pathways for energy efficient trajectory designs.","Xavier Tricoche,Wayne Schlei,Kathleen Howell",f-scivis-1199,Extraction and Visualization of Poincaré Map Topology for Spacecraft Trajectory Design
f-scivis-1101,"Empirical models, fitted to data from observations, are often used in natural sciences to describe physical behaviour and support discoveries. However, with more complex models, the regression of parameters quickly becomes insufficient, requiring a visual parameter space analysis to understand and optimize the models. In this work, we present a design study for building a model describing atmospheric convection. We present a mixed-initiative approach to visually guided modelling, integrating an interactive visual parameter space analysis with partial automatic parameter optimization. Our approach includes a new, semi-automatic technique called IsoTrotting, where we optimize the procedure by navigating along isocontours of the model. We evaluate the model with unique observational data of atmospheric convection based on flight trajectories of paragliders.","Juraj Pálenik,Thomas Spengler,Helwig Hauser",f-scivis-1101,IsoTrotter: Visually Guided Empirical Modelling of Convection in Meteorology
f-scivis-1137,"We present an atmospheric model tailored for the interactive visualization of planetary surfaces. As the exploration of the solar system is progressing with increasingly accurate missions and instruments, the faithful visualization of planetary environments is gaining increasing interest in space research, mission planning, and science communication and education. Atmospheric effects are crucial in data analysis and to provide contextual information for planetary data. Our model correctly accounts for the non-linear path of the light inside the atmosphere (in Earth's case), the light absorption effects by molecules and dust particles, such as the ozone layer and the Martian dust, and a wavelength-dependent phase function for Mie scattering. The mode focuses on interactivity, versatility, and customization, and a comprehensive set of interactive controls make it possible to adapt its appearance dynamically. We demonstrate our results using Earth and Mars as examples. However, it can be readily adapted for the exploration of other atmospheres found on, for example, of exoplanets. For Earth's atmosphere, we visually compare our results with pictures taken from the International Space Station and against the CIE clear sky model. The Martian atmosphere is reproduced based on available scientific data, feedback from domain experts, and is compared to images taken by the Curiosity rover. The work presented here has been implemented in the OpenSpace system, which enables interactive parameter setting and real-time feedback visualization targeting presentations in a wide range of environments, from immersive dome theaters to virtual reality headsets.","Jonathas Costa,Alexander Bock,Carter Emmart,Charles Hansen,Anders Ynnerman,Claudio Silva",f-scivis-1137,Interactive Visualization of Atmospheric Effects for Celestial Bodies

Our solution is GPU-based and builds upon a two-step approach, where we first derive an adaptive grid to map the 360-view around the observer to the distorted celestial sky, which can be directly reused for different camera orientations. Using a grid, we can rapidly trace rays back to the observer through the distorted spacetime, avoiding the heavy workload of standard tracing solutions at real-time rates. By using a novel interpolation technique we can also simulate an observer path by smoothly transitioning between multiple grids. Our approach accepts real star catalogues and environment maps of the celestial sky and generates the resulting black-hole deformations in real time.","Annemieke Verbraeck,Elmar Eisemann",f-scivis-1170,Interactive Black-Hole Visualization

Researchers can interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data.

While other storytelling formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and principles for ""data-GIFs"". To close this gap, we provide results from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118 participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the understandability of data-GIFs.

f-info-1088,"Multiple-view visualization (MV) is a layout design technique often employed to help users see a large number of data attributes and values in a single cohesive representation. Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts. We combine the findings into a MV recommendation system, providing interactive tools to explore the design space, and support example-based design.","Xi Chen,Wei Zeng,Yanna Lin,Hayder Al-maneea,Jonathan Roberts,Remco Chang",f-info-1088,Composition and Configuration Patterns in Multiple-View Visualizations

For the last decade, these layouts have served as fundamental idioms in designing many visualization systems. However, we found that the layouts have been used with inconsistent terms and confusion, and the lessons from previous studies are fragmented. The goal of our research is to distill the results from previous studies into a consistent and reusable framework. We review 127 research papers, including 15 papers with quantitative user studies, which employed comparative layouts. We ﬁrst alleviate the ambiguous boundaries in the design space of comparative layouts by suggesting lucid terminology (e.g., chart-wise and item-wise juxtaposition). We then identify the diverse aspects of comparative layouts, such as the advantages and concerns of using each layout in the real-world scenarios and researchers' approaches to overcome the concerns. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from the Gleicher et al.'s survey [19], we elaborate on relevant empirical evidence that we distilled from our survey (e.g., the actual effectiveness of the layouts in different study settings) and identify novel facets that the original work did not cover (e.g., the familiarity of the layouts to people). Finally, we show the consistent and contradictory results on the performance of comparative layouts and offer practical implications for using the layouts by suggesting trade-offs and seven actionable guidelines.","Sehi L'Yi,Jaemin Jo,Jinwook Seo",f-info-1372,"Comparative Layouts Revisited: Design Space, Guidelines, and Future Directions"
f-vast-1250,"We present a comprehensive framework for evaluating line chart smoothing methods under a variety of visual analytics tasks. Line charts are commonly used to visualize a series of data samples. When the number of samples is large, or the data are noisy, smoothing can be applied to make the signal more apparent. However, there are a wide variety of smoothing techniques available, and the effectiveness of each depends upon both nature of the data and the visual analytics task at hand. To date, the visualization community lacks a summary work for analyzing and classifying the various smoothing methods available. In this paper, we establish a framework, based on 8 measures of the line smoothing effectiveness tied to 8 low-level visual analytics tasks. We then analyze 12 methods coming from 4 commonly used classes of line chart smoothing—rank filters, convolutional filters, frequency domain filters, and subsampling. The results show that while no method is ideal for all situations, certain methods, such as Gaussian filters and topology-based subsampling, perform well in general. Other methods, such as low-pass cutoff filters and Douglas-Peucker subsampling, perform well for specific visual analytics tasks. Almost as importantly, our framework demonstrates that several methods, including the commonly used uniform subsampling, produce low-quality results, and should, therefore, be avoided, if possible.","Paul Rosen,Ghulam Jilani Quadri",f-vast-1250,LineSmooth: An Analytical Framework for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Smoothing Techniques on Line Charts
f-vast-1197,"In machine learning (ML), ensemble methods—such as bagging, boosting, and stacking—are widely-established approaches that regularly achieve top-notch predictive performance. Stacking (also called “stacked generalization”) is an ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of those models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the predictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from, and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models) that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics, managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data set, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decide between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack by removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and effectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world healthcare data set and a collection of data related to sentiment/stance detection in texts. Finally, the tool has been evaluated through interviews with three ML experts.","Angelos Chatzimparmpas,Rafael M.

f-info-1041,"Immersive technologies offer new opportunities to support collaborative visual data analysis by providing each collaborator a personal, high-resolution view of a flexible shared visualisation space through a head mounted display. However, most prior studies of collaborative immersive analytics have focused on how groups interact with surface interfaces such as tabletops and wall displays. This paper reports on a study in which teams of three co-located participants are given flexible visualisation authoring tools to allow a great deal of control in how they structure their shared workspace. They do so using a prototype system we call FIESTA: the Free-roaming Immersive Environment to Support Team-based Analysis. Unlike traditional visualisation tools, FIESTA allows users to freely position authoring interfaces and visualisation artefacts anywhere in the virtual environment, either on virtual surfaces or suspended within the interaction space. Our participants solved visual analytics tasks on a multivariate data set, doing so individually and collaboratively by creating a large number of 2D and 3D visualisations. Their behaviours suggest that the usage of surfaces is coupled with the type of visualisation used, often using walls to organise 2D visualisations, but positioning 3D visualisations in the space around them. Outside of tightly-coupled collaboration, participants followed social protocols and did not interact with visualisations that did not belong to them even if outside of its owner's personal workspace.","Benjamin Lee,Xiaoyun Hu,Maxime Cordeil,Arnaud Prouzeau,Bernhard Jenny,Tim Dwyer",f-info-1041,Shared Surfaces and Spaces: Collaborative Data Visualisation in a Co-located Immersive Environment

Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data.

These processes are typically imagined as formalised, extended activities, between groups of dedicated experts, requiring expertise with sophisticated data analysis tools. However, there are many professional domains that benefit from support for short `bursts' of data exploration between a subset of stakeholders with a diverse breadth of knowledge. Such `casual collaborative' scenarios will require engaging features to draw users' attention, with intuitive, `walk-up and use' interfaces. This paper presents Uplift, a novel prototype system to support `casual collaborative visual analytics' for a campus microgrid, co-designed with local stakeholders. An elicitation workshop with key members of the building management team revealed relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using bespoke analysis tools. Uplift combines an engaging 3D model on a central tabletop display with intuitive tangible interaction, as well as augmented-reality, mid-air data visualisation, in order to support casual collaborative visual analytics for this complex domain. Evaluations with expert stakeholders from the building management and energy domains were conducted during and following our prototype development and indicate that Uplift is successful as an engaging backdrop for casual collaboration.

f-info-1021,"Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations offer entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating them is a core component. However, evaluating them is intrinsically tricky as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. Thus, to overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. The main assumption behind this approach is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Based on those results, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that investigating situated visualizations is not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Thus, we argue that when investigating situated visualizations, researchers can conclude from all empirical study methods and comparisons between different methods.","Maximilian Weiß,Katrin Angerbauer,Alexandra Voit,Magdalena Schwarzl,Michael Sedlmair,Sven Mayer",f-info-1021,Revisited: Comparison of Empirical Methods to Evaluate Visualizations Supporting Crafting and Assembly Purposes

We report the findings of the first systematic study of immersive navigation techniques for 3D scatterplots. We tested four conditions that represent our best attempt to adapt standard 2D navigation techniques to data visualization in an immersive environment while still providing standard immersive navigation techniques through physical movement and teleportation. We compared room-sized visualization versus a zooming interface, each with and without an overview.  We find significant differences in participants' response times and accuracy for a number of standard visual analysis tasks. Both zoom and overview provide benefits over standard locomotion support alone (i.e., physical movement and pointer teleportation). However, which variation is superior, depends on the task. We obtain a more nuanced understanding of the results by analyzing them in terms of a time-cost model for the different components of navigation: way-finding, travel, number of travel steps, and context switching.","Yalong Yang,Maxime Cordeil,Johanna Beyer,Tim Dwyer,Kim Marriott,Hanspeter Pfister",f-info-1169,Embodied Navigation in Immersive Abstract Data Visualization: Is Overview+Detail or Zooming Better for 3D Scatterplots?
f-vast-1010,"In this work, we propose a generic visual analytics framework to support tactic analysis based on data collected from racquet sports (such as tennis and badminton). The proposed approach models each rally in a game as a sequence of hits (i.e., events) until one athlete scores a point. Each hit can be described with a set of attributes, such as the positions of the ball and the techniques used to hit the ball (such as drive and volley in tennis). Thus, the mentioned sequence of hits can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. By detecting and analyzing the multivariate subsequences that frequently occur in the rallies (namely, tactical patterns), athletes can gain insights into the playing styles adopted by their opponents, and therefore help them identify systematic weaknesses of the opponents and develop counter strategies in matches. To support such analysis effectively, we propose a steerable multivariate sequential pattern mining algorithm with adjustable weights over event attributes, such that the domain expert can obtain frequent tactical patterns according to the attributes specified by himself. We also propose a re-configurable glyph design to help users simultaneously analyze multiple attributes of the hits. The framework further supports comparative analysis of the tactical patterns, e.g., for different athletes or the same athlete playing under different conditions. By applying the framework on two datasets collected in tennis and badminton matches, we demonstrate that the system is generic and effective for tactic analysis in sports and can help identify signature techniques used by individual athletes. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach based on the feedback from the domain experts.","Jiang Wu,Ziyang Guo,Zuobin Wang,Qingyang Xu,Yingcai Wu",f-vast-1010,Visual Analytics of Multivariate Event Sequence Data in Racquet Sports
f-tvcg-2019060193," A possible objective in analyzing trajectories of multiple simultaneously moving objects, such as football players during a game, is to extract and understand the general patterns of coordinated movement in different classes of situations as they develop. For achieving this objective, we propose an approach that includes a combination of query techniques for flexible selection of episodes of situation development, a method for dynamic aggregation of data from selected groups of episodes, and a data structure for representing the aggregates that enables their exploration and use in further analysis. The aggregation, which is meant to abstract general movement patterns, involves construction of new time-homomorphic reference systems owing to iterative application of aggregation operators to a sequence of data selections. As similar patterns may occur at different spatial locations, we also propose constructing new spatial reference systems for aligning and matching movements irrespective of their absolute locations. The approach was tested in application to tracking data from two Bundesliga games of the 2018/2019 season. It enabled detection of interesting and meaningful general patterns of team behaviors in three classes of situations defined by football experts.

To address the problem, we closely collaborate with domain experts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a team's passing tactics. To characterize the passing tactic employed for each attack, we propose a topic-based approach that provides a high-level abstraction of complex passing behaviors.

f-vast-1152,"Causality is crucial to understanding the mechanisms behind complex systems and making decisions that lead to intended outcomes. Event sequence data is widely collected from many real-world processes, such as electronic health records, web clickstreams, and financial transactions, which transmit a great deal of information reflecting the causal relations among event types. Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are often connected to rather complex underlying event excitation mechanisms that are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics method for recovering causalities in event sequence data. We extend the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal comparison through a set of novel visualizations and interactions. We report two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements resulting from the user-feedback mechanism, and a qualitative evaluation through case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.","Zhuochen Jin,Shunan Guo,Nan Chen,Daniel Weiskopf,David Gotz,Nan Cao",f-vast-1152,Visual Causality Analysis of Event Sequence Data

First, making sense of the reasoning in intermediate steps is time-consuming. Especially in distributed sensemaking, the provenance is less cohesive because each analyst only sees a small portion of the data without an understanding of the overall collaboration workflow. Second, analysis errors from one step can propagate to later steps. Furthermore, in exploratory sensemaking, it is difficult to define what an error is since there are no correct answers to reference. In this paper, we explore provenance analysis for distributed sensemaking in the context of crowdsourcing, where distributed analysis contributions are captured in microtasks. We propose crowd auditing as a way to help individual analysts visualize and trace provenance to debug distributed sensemaking.

We focus our exploratory study on whether personality has an effect on user preferences regarding idioms used for hierarchy, evolution over time, and comparison contexts. Specifically, we leverage all personality variables from the Five-Factor Model and the three dimensions from Locus of Control (LoC) with correlation and clustering approaches. The correlation-based method suggested that Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, several facets from each trait, and the External dimensions from LoC mediate how much individuals prefer certain idioms. In addition, our results from the cluster-based analysis showed that Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and all dimensions from LoC have an effect on preferences for idioms in hierarchy and evolution contexts. Our results support the incorporation of in-depth personality synergies with InfoVis into the design pipeline of visualization systems.","Tomás Alves,Bárbara Ramalho,Joana Henriques-Calado,Daniel Gonçalves,Sandra Gama",s-short-1204,Exploring How Personality Models Information Visualization Preferences

s-short-1231,"Chartjunk is a popular yet contentious topic. In recent years it has seen increasing research interest, with studies investigating phenomena such as memorability, engagement, preference, and performance. These studies have shown that extreme minimalism is not always best, and that visual embellishments can be useful depending on the context. While more knowledge is being developed regarding the effects of embellishments on users, less attention has been given to the perspectives of practitioners regarding how they design with embellishments. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 data visualization practitioners, investigating how they understand chartjunk and the factors that influence how and when they make use of embellishments. Our analysis uncovers a broad and pluralistic understanding of chartjunk among practitioners, and foregrounds a variety of personal and situated factors that influence the use of chartjunk beyond mere context. We highlight the personal nature of design practice, and discuss the need for more practice-led visualization research to better understand the ways in which concepts like chartjunk are interpreted and used by practitioners.","Paul Parsons,Prakash Chandra Shukla",s-short-1231,Data Visualization Practitioners' Perspectives on Chartjunk
f-vast-1235,"Bus routes are typically updated every 3--5 years to meet constantly changing travel demands. However, identifying deficient bus routes and finding their optimal replacements remain challenging due to the difficulties in analyzing a complex bus network and the large solution space comprising alternative routes. Most of the automated approaches cannot produce satisfactory results in real-world settings without laborious inspection and evaluation of the candidates. The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us to collaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning of bus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus network into three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes. For challenge b, we improve a route generation model and interpret the performance of the generation with tailored visualizations. For challenge c, we incorporate a conflict resolution strategy in the progressive decision-making process to assist users in evaluating the alternative routes and finding the most optimal one.

Conventional methods for constructing density maps are mainly based on Euclidean distance, limiting their applicability in urban analysis that shall consider road network and urban traffic. In this work, we propose a new method named Topology Density Map, targeting for accurate and intuitive density maps in the context of urban environment. Based on the various constraints of road connections and traffic conditions, the method first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that propagates nonlinear scalar fields along 1D road networks. Next, the method extends the scalar fields to a 2D space by identifying key intersecting points in the DAG, dividing the underlying territory into planar regions using a weighted Voronoi diagram, and calculating the scalar fields for every point. Two case studies demonstrate that the Topology Density Map supplies accurate information to users and provides an intuitive visualization for decision making.

In this work, we study a big mobile location dataset that covers millions of city residents, but is temporally sparse on the trajectory of individual user. Mapping sparse trajectories to illustrate population movement poses several challenges from both analysis and visualization perspectives. In the literature, there are a few techniques designed for sparse trajectory visualization; yet they do not consider trajectories collected from mobile apps that possess long-tailed sparsity with record intervals as long as hours. This work introduces UrbanMotion, a visual analytics system that extends the original wind map design by supporting map-matched local movements, multi-directional population flows, and population distributions. Effective methods are proposed to extract and aggregate population movements from dense parts of the trajectories leveraging their long-tailed sparsity. Both characteristic and anomalous patterns are discovered and visualized. We conducted three case studies, one comparative experiment, and collected expert feedback in the application domains of commuting analysis, event detection, and business site configuration.

f-vast-1045,"Deep learning methods are being increasingly used for urban traffic prediction where spatiotemporal traffic data is aggregated into sequentially organized matrices that are then fed into convolution-based residual neural networks. However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs. This issue can significantly destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions – rendering deep networks much less useful for the experts. This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors across space, 2) a Moran's I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with domain experts. We observe that geographical scale variations have important impact on prediction performances, and interactive visual exploration of dynamically varying inputs and outputs benefit experts in the development of deep traffic prediction models.","Wei Zeng,Chengqiao Lin,Juncong Lin,Jincheng Jiang,Jiazhi Xia,Cagatay Turkay,Wei Chen",f-vast-1045,Revisiting the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem in Deep Traffic Prediction with Visual Analytics
f-tvcg-20192940580,"Urban traffic congestion has become an important issue not only affecting our daily lives, but also limiting economic development. The primary cause of urban traffic congestion is that the number of vehicles is higher than the permissible limit of the road. Previous studies have focused on dispersing traffic volume by detecting urban traffic congestion zones and predicting future trends. However, to solve the fundamental problem, it is necessary to discover the cause of traffic congestion. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find a research which presents an approach to identify the causes of traffic congestion. In this paper, we propose a technique to analyze the cause of traffic congestion based on the traffic flow theory. We extract vehicle flows from traffic data, such as GPS trajectory and Vehicle Detector data. We detect vehicle flow changes utilizing the entropy from the information theory. Then, we build cumulative vehicle count curves (N-curve) that can quantify the flow of the vehicles in the traffic congestion area. The N-curves are classified into four different traffic congestion patterns by a convolutional neural network. Analyzing the causes and influence of traffic congestion is difficult and requires considerable experience and knowledge. Therefore, we present a visual analytics system that can efficiently perform a series of processes to analyze the cause and influence of traffic congestion. Through case studies, we have evaluated that our system can classify the causes of traffic congestion and can be used efficiently in road planning.","Mingyu Pi,Hanbyul Yeon,Hyesook Son,Yun Jang",f-tvcg-20192940580,Visual Cause Analytics for Traffic Congestion
f-tvcg-2018110405,"São Paulo is the largest city in South America, with crime rates that reflect its size. The number and type of crimes vary considerably around the city, assuming different patterns depending on urban and social characteristics of each particular location. Previous works have mostly focused on the analysis of crimes with the intent of uncovering patterns associated to social factors, seasonality, and urban routine activities. Therefore, those studies and tools are more global in the sense that they are not designed to investigate specific regions of the city such as particular neighborhoods, avenues, or public areas. Tools able to explore specific locations of the city are essential for domain experts to accomplish their analysis in a bottom-up fashion revealing how urban features related to mobility, passersby behavior, and presence of public infrastructures (e.g., terminals of public transportation and schools) can influence the quantity and type of crimes. In this paper, we present CrimAnalyzer, a visual analytic tool that allows users to study the behavior of crimes in specific regions of a city. The system allows users to identify local hotspots and the pattern of crimes associated to them, while still showing how hotspots and corresponding crime patterns change over time. CrimAnalyzer has been developed from the needs of a team of experts in criminology and deals with three major challenges: i) flexibility to explore local regions and understand their crime patterns, ii) identification of spatial crime hotspots that might not be the most prevalent ones in terms of the number of crimes but that are important enough to be investigated, and iii) understand the dynamic of crime patterns over time. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as by case studies run by domain experts involving real data.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game – one with narrative elements and one without – and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game.

f-info-1451,"Significant research has provided robust task and evaluation languages for the analysis of exploratory visualizations. Unfortunately, these taxonomies fail when applied to communicative visualization. Instead, designers often resort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efficiency perspective: ""can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?"" However, designers are unlikely to be satisfied if the message went 'in one ear and out the other.' The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difficult to design or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we address is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe their intent, and the language they have.  We argue that visualization designers can address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a student and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can better define, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate how the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide array of communicative goals.  To understand how the framework can be applied (and its limitations), we surveyed and interviewed members of the Data Visualization Society using their own visualizations as a probe.

They are an established, effective way to show complex data per spatial element, using visual encodings within each tile ranging from simple coloring to nested small-multiples visualizations. An effective grid map is coherent with the underlying geographic space: the tiles maintain the contiguity, neighborhoods and identifiability of the corresponding spatial elements, while the grid map as a whole maintains the global shape of the input. Of particular importance are salient local features of the global shape which need to be represented by tiles assigned to the appropriate spatial elements. State-of-the-art techniques can adequately deal only with simple cases, such as close-to-uniform spatial distributions or global shapes that have few characteristic features. We introduce a simple fully-automated 3-step pipeline for computing coherent grid maps. Each step is a well-studied problem: shape decomposition based on salient features, tile-based Mosaic Cartograms, and point-set matching. Our pipeline is a seamless composition of existing techniques for these problems and results in high-quality grid maps.

f-info-1290,"Visualizing spatial data on small-screen devices such as smartphones and smartwatches poses new challenges in computational cartography. The current interfaces for map exploration require their users to zoom in and out frequently. Indeed, zooming and panning are tools suitable for choosing the map extent corresponding to an area of interest. They are not as suitable, however, for resolving the graphical clutter caused by a high feature density since zooming in to a large map scale leads to a loss of context. Therefore, in this paper, we present new external labeling methods that allow a user to navigate through dense sets of points of interest while keeping the current map extent fixed. We provide a unified model, in which labels are placed at the boundary of the map and visually associated with the corresponding features via connecting lines, which are called leaders. Since the screen space is limited, labeling all features at the same time is impractical. Therefore, at any time, we label a subset of the features. We offer interaction techniques to change the current selection of features systematically and, thus, give the user access to all features. We distinguish three methods, which allow the user either to slide the labels along the bottom side of the map or to browse the labels based on pages or stacks. We present a generic algorithmic framework that provides us with the possibility of expressing the different variants of interaction techniques as optimization problems in a unified way. We propose both exact algorithms and fast and simple heuristics that solve the optimization problems taking into account different criteria such as the ranking of the labels, the total leader length as well as the distance between leaders. In experiments on real-world data we evaluate these algorithms and discuss the three variants with respect to their strengths and weaknesses proving the flexibility of the presented algorithmic framework.","Sven Gedicke,Annika Bonerath,Benjamin Niedermann,Jan-Henrik Haunert",f-info-1290,Zoomless Maps: External Labeling Methods for the Interactive Exploration of Dense Point Sets at a Fixed Map Scale

The first step for intelligent response in visualizations is to enable computers to infer user goals and strategies through observing their interactions with a system. Researchers have proposed multiple techniques to model users, however, their frameworks often depend on the visualization design, interaction space, and dataset. Due to these dependencies, many techniques do not provide a general algorithmic solution to user exploration modeling. In this paper, we construct a series of models based on the dataset and pose user exploration modeling as a Bayesian model selection problem where we maintain a belief over numerous competing models that could explain user interactions. Each of these competing models represent an exploration strategy the user could adopt during a session. The goal of our technique is to make high-level and in-depth inferences about the user by observing their low-level interactions. Although our proposed idea is applicable to various probabilistic model spaces, we demonstrate a specific instance of encoding exploration patterns as competing models to infer information relevance. We validate our technique's ability to infer exploration bias, predict future interactions, and summarize an analytic session using user study datasets. Our results indicate that depending on the application, our method outperforms established baselines for bias detection and future interaction prediction.

f-vast-1109,"In this paper, we introduce II-20 (Image Insight 2020), a multimedia analytics approach for analytic categorization of image collections. Advanced visualizations for image collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to support the task of analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that truly brings the user to insight requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions: a human thinks about image data mostly in semantic terms. II-20 brings three major contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a new machine model that closely follows the user's interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's machine model, in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art's ability to produce relevant suggestions, allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without any additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows a well-trained model to analyze the collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user to harness the model to quickly expand (""fast-forward'"") the categories of relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary. Automated experiments show that II-20's machine model outperforms the existing state of the art and also demonstrate the Tetris metaphor's analytic quality.

We provide users with a set of advanced utilities for constructing CMS's with various levels of complexity, examining their quality attributes using different plots, and exporting them to external application software. We present two case studies, demonstrating that the CCC-Tool can help domain scientists as well as visualization experts in designing semantically-rich colormaps.","Pascal Nardini ,Min Chen ,Francesca Samsel, Roxana Bujack,Michael Böttinger,Gerik Scheuermann",f-tvcg-2019010013,The Making of Continuous Colormaps

A prior power analysis examines the relationships among multiple parameters, including the complexity associated with human participants, e.g., order and fatigue effects, to calculate the statistical power of a given experiment design. We created Argus, a tool that supports interactive exploration of statistical power: Researchers specify experiment design scenarios with varying confounds and effect sizes. Argus then simulates data and visualizes statistical power across these scenarios, which lets researchers interactively weigh various trade-offs and make informed decisions about sample size. We describe the design and implementation of Argus, a usage scenario designing a visualization experiment, and a think-aloud study.","Xiaoyi Wang,Alexander Eiselmayer,Wendy Mackay,Kasper Hornbæk,Chat Wacharamanotham",f-vast-1070,Argus: Interactive a priori Power Analysis
s-short-1003,Natural language interaction with data visualization tools often involves the use of vague subjective modifiers in utterances such as “show me the sectors that are performing” and “where is a good neighborhood to buy a house?.” Interpreting these modifiers is often difficult for these tools because their meanings lack clear semantics and are in part defined by context and personal user preferences. This paper presents a system called Sentifiers that makes a first step in better understanding these vague predicates. The algorithm employs word co-occurrence and sentiment analysis to determine which data attributes and filters ranges to associate with the vague predicates. The provenance results from the algorithm are exposed to the user as interactive text that can be repaired and refined. We conduct a qualitative evaluation of the Sentifiers that indicates the usefulness of the interface as well as opportunities for better supporting subjective utterances in visual analysis tasks through natural language.,"Vidya Setlur,Arathi S.

f-cga-7,"Existing graph layout algorithms are usually not able to optimize all the aesthetic properties desired in a graph layout. To evaluate how well the desired visual features are reflected in a graph layout, many readability metrics have been proposed in the past decades. However, the calculation of these readability metrics often requires access to the node and edge coordinates and is usually computationally inefficient, especially for dense graphs. Importantly, when the node and edge coordinates are not accessible, it becomes impossible to evaluate the graph layouts quantitatively. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based approach to evaluate the readability of graph layouts by directly using graph images. A convolutional neural network architecture is proposed and trained on a benchmark dataset of graph images, which is composed of synthetically generated graphs and graphs created by sampling from real large networks. Multiple representative readability metrics (including edge crossing, node spread, and group overlap) are considered in the proposed approach. We quantitatively compare our approach to traditional methods and qualitatively evaluate our approach by showing usage scenarios and visualizing convolutional layers.

Furthermore, we identify implications to accommodate iterative refinement, context, variability, and uncertainty during all stages of the framework.

f-scivis-1049,"Multidimensional Projection is a fundamental tool for high-dimensional data analytics and visualization. With very few exceptions, projection techniques are designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as to preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean distance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical formulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most multidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures that encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity relation between data objects. However, geometric relations is not the only interesting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the analysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more reliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to topological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper introduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological guarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method performs the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while preserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the high-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same connected components when applied to the original as well as projected data. The presented case studies show that the topological guarantee provided by TopoMap not only brings confidence to the visual analytic process but also can be used to assist in the assessment of other projection methods.","Harish Doraiswamy,Julien Tierny,Paulo J.

f-scivis-1057,"This paper describes a localized algorithm for the topological simplification of scalar data, an essential pre-processing step of topological data analysis (TDA). Given a scalar field f and a selection of extrema to preserve, the proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that is close to f and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, sub- and superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first locally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field, such that these regions are guaranteed---from a combinatorial perspective---to no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global approaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that actually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup. Moreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize shared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high parallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for the exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent topological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall execution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds, with an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to x36. Furthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on topological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined persistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and its resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and acquired datasets from different application domains, including physics, chemistry, and biomedical imaging.","Jonas Lukasczyk,Christoph Garth,Ross Maciejewski,Julien Tierny",f-scivis-1057,Localized Topological Simplification of Scalar Data

Moreover, the mode surfaces extracted from neighboring cells have gaps, which make their subsequent analysis difficult. In this paper, we provide novel analysis on the topological structures of mode surfaces, including a common parameterization of all mode surfaces of a tensor field using 2D asymmetric tensors. This allows us to not only better understand the structures in mode surfaces and their interactions with degenerate curves and neutral surfaces, but also develop an efficient algorithm to seamlessly extract mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces.

f-scivis-1209,"In this paper we present a user-friendly sketching-based suggestive interface for untangling mathematical knots with complicated structures. Rather than treating mathematical knots as if they were 3D ropes, our interface is designed to assist the user to interact with knots with the right sequence of mathematically legal moves. Our knot interface allows one to sketch and untangle knots by proposing the Reidemeister moves, and can guide the user to untangle mathematical knots to the fewest possible number of crossings by suggesting the moves needed. The system highlights parts of the knot where the Reidemeister moves are applicable, suggests the possible moves, and constrains the user's drawing to legal moves only. This ongoing suggestion is based on a Reidemeister move analyzer, that reads the evolving knot in its Gauss code and predicts the needed Reidemeister moves towards the fewest possible number of crossings. For our principal test case of mathematical knot diagrams, this for the first time permits us to visualize, analyze, and deform them in a mathematical visual interface. In addition, understanding of a fairly long mathematical deformation sequence in our interface can be aided by visual analysis and comparison over the identified “key moments” where only critical changes occur in the sequence. Our knot interface allows users to track and trace mathematical knot deformation with a significantly reduced number of visual frames containing only the Reidemeister moves being applied.

However, previous detection methods of the viscous and gravitational fingers are based on density thresholding, which provides limited geometric information of the fingers. The geometric structures of fingers and their evolution are important yet little studied in the literature. In this work, we explore the geometric detection and evolution of the fingers in detail to elucidate the dynamics of the instability. We propose a ridge voxel detection method to guide the extraction of finger cores from three-dimensional (3D) scalar fields. After skeletonizing finger cores into skeletons, we design a spanning tree based approach to capture how fingers branch spatially from the finger skeletons. Finally, we devise a novel geometric-glyph augmented tracking graph to study how the fingers and their branches grow, merge, and split over time.

We discuss how different parameter choices lead to different trade-offs in practice, and show how specific choices result in known data representation schemes such as zfp, IDX, and JPEG2000. Finally, we provide system-level details and empirical evidence on how such hierarchies facilitate common approximate queries with minimal data movement and time, using real-world data sets ranging from a few gigabytes to nearly a terabyte in size.

However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in 'hairball' visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology—finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy andresponse time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty.

Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise.

However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage.

To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues.  MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable.

f-info-1326,"We present an integrated approach for creating and assigning color palettes to different visualizations such as multi-class scatterplots, line, and bar charts. Other approaches separate the creation of colors from their assignment. In contrast, our approach takes data characteristics already into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination. We compared our approach to state-of-the-art palettes with a controlled user study for scatterplots and line charts and performed a case study. Our results show that Palettailor, as a fully-automated approach, generates color palettes with a higher discrimination quality than existing approaches. The efficiency of our optimization allows us also to incorporate user modifications into the color selection process.","Kecheng Lu,Mi Feng,Xin Chen,Michael Sedlmair,Oliver Deussen,Dani Lischinski,Zhanglin Cheng,Yunhai Wang",f-info-1326,Palettailor: Discriminable Colorization for Categorical Data
f-info-1111,"Animated transitions help viewers follow changes between related visualizations. Specifying effective animations demands significant effort: authors must select the elements and properties to animate, provide transition parameters, and coordinate the timing of stages. To facilitate this process, we present Gemini, a declarative grammar and recommendation system for animated transitions between single-view statistical graphics. Gemini specifications define transition “steps” in terms of high-level visual components (marks, axes, legends) and composition rules to synchronize and concatenate steps. With this grammar, Gemini can recommend animation designs to augment and accelerate designers' work. Gemini enumerates staged animation designs for given start and end states, and ranks those designs using a cost function informed by prior perceptual studies. To evaluate Gemini, we conduct both a formative study on Mechanical Turk to assess and tune our ranking function, and a summative study in which 8 experienced visualization developers implement animations in D3 that we then compare to Gemini's suggestions. We find that most designs (9/11) are exactly replicable in Gemini, with many (8/11) achievable via edits to suggestions, and that Gemini suggestions avoid multiple participant errors.","Younghoon Kim,Jeffrey Heer",f-info-1111,Gemini: A Grammar and Recommender System for Animated Transitions in Statistical Graphics

Systems such as Tableau have started to amass increasingly large repositories of analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization workbooks. When shared, these collections can form a visual analytic knowledge base. However, as the size of a collection increases, so does the difficulty in finding relevant information. Content-based recommendation (CBR) systems could help analysts in finding and managing workbooks relevant to their interests. Toward this goal, we focus on text-based content that is representative of the subject matter of visualizations rather than the visual encodings and style. We discuss the challenges associated with creating a CBR based on visualization specifications and explore more concretely how to implement the relevance measures required using Tableau workbook specifications as the source of content data. We also demonstrate what information can be extracted from these visualization specifications and how various natural language processing techniques can be used to compute similarity between workbooks as one way to measure relevance. We report on a crowd-sourced user study to determine if our similarity measure mimics human judgement. Finally, we choose latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a specific model and instantiate it in a proof-of-concept recommender tool to demonstrate the basic function of our similarity measure.","Michael Oppermann,Robert Kincaid,Tamara Munzner",f-vast-1247,VizCommender: Computing Text-Based Similarity in Visualization Repositories for Content-Based Recommendations

Our proposed Deep Volumetric Ambient Occlusion (DVAO) approach can predict per-voxel ambient occlusion in volumetric data sets, while considering global information provided through the transfer function. The proposed neural network only needs to be executed upon change of this global information, and thus supports real-time volume interaction. Accordingly, we demonstrate DVAO's ability to predict volumetric ambient occlusion, such that it can be applied interactively within direct volume rendering. To achieve the best possible results, we propose and analyze a variety of transfer function representations and injection strategies for deep neural networks. Based on the obtained results we also give recommendations applicable in similar volume learning scenarios.

At present, visualization is mainly applied to explore and explain neural networks. Its counterpart - the application of deep learning to visualization problems - requires us to share data more openly in order to enable more scientists to engage in data-driven research. In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size. Using our public fluid data set, we trained deep convolutional neural networks in order to set a benchmark for an improved post-hoc Lagrangian fluid flow analysis. In in-situ settings, flow maps are exported and interpolated in order to assess the transport characteristics of time-dependent fluids. Using deep learning, we improve the accuracy of flow map interpolations, allowing a more precise flow analysis at a reduced memory IO footprint.","Jakob Jakob,Markus Gross,Tobias Günther",f-scivis-1180,A Fluid Flow Data Set for Machine Learning and its Application to Neural Flow Map Interpolation

f-scivis-1095,"The fundamental motivation of the proposed work is to present a new visualization-guided computing paradigm to combine direct 3D volume processing and volume rendered clues for effective 3D exploration. For example, extracting and visualizing microstructure in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP -- a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small / micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro-)cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.","Yifan Wang,Guoli Yan,Haikuan Zhu,Sagar Buch,Ying Wang,Ewart Haacke,Jing Hua,Zichun Zhong",f-scivis-1095,VC-Net: Deep Volume-Composition Networks for Segmentation and Visualization of Highly Sparse and Noisy Image Data

In this paper, we present an interactive system for domain scientists to visually study the multiple attributes learning models applied to x-ray scattering images. It allows domain scientists to interactively explore this important type of scientific images in embedded spaces that are defined on the model prediction output, the actual labels, and the discovered feature space of neural networks. Users are allowed to flexibly select instance images, their clusters, and compare them with the specified visual representation of attributes. The exploration is guided by the manifestation of model performance related to mutual relationships among attributes, which often affect the learning accuracy and effectiveness. The system thus supports domain scientists to improve the training dataset and model, find questionable attributes labels, and identify outlier images or spurious data clusters.

Reducing this number lies at the core of research in volume rendering. With the advent of deep learning networks, a number of architectures have been proposed recently to infer missing samples in multi-dimensional fields, for applications such as image super-resolution. In this paper, we investigate the use of such architectures for learning the upscaling of a low-resolution sampling of an isosurface to a higher resolution, with reconstruction of spatial detail and shading. We introduce a fully convolutional neural network, to learn a latent representation generating smooth, edge-aware depth and normal fields as well as ambient occlusions from a low-resolution depth and normal field. By adding a frame-to-frame motion loss into the learning stage, upscaling can consider temporal variations and achieves improved frame-to-frame coherence. We assess the quality of inferred results and compare it to bi-linear and -cubic upscaling.

f-vast-1122,"Most visual analytics systems assume that all foraging for data happens before the analytics process; once analysis begins, the set of data attributes considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.","Dylan Cashman,Shenyu Xu,Subhajit Das,Florian Heimerl,Cong Liu,Shah Rukh Humayoun,Michael Gleicher,Alex Endert,Remco Chang",f-vast-1122,CAVA: A Visual Analytics System for Exploratory Columnar Data Augmentation Using Knowledge Graphs

Here, we present and evaluate nine recommendations for the design of interactive visualisation tools supporting the Problem-Solving Loop. They range from the choice of visual representation for solutions and constraints to the use of a solution gallery to support exploration of alternate solutions. We first examined the applicability of the recommendations by investigating how well they had been supported in previous interactive optimisation tools. We then evaluated the recommendations in the context of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). To do so we built a sophisticated interactive visual system for solving VRPTW that was informed by the recommendations. Ten participants then used this system to solve a variety of routing problems. We report on participant comments and interaction patterns with the tool.

Prior work on correlation perception has not considered how factors including prior beliefs and uncertainty representation impact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact of uncertainty communication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model how users update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a scatterplot with and without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate the belief updating, we present three studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed ''Line + Cone'' visual elicitation method for capturing users' beliefs in an accurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of belief solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users' uncertainty about a range of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the ``Line + Cone'' elicitation method to measure belief updating on the relationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation visualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes in users beliefs to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide normative benchmarks for how users should update their prior beliefs about a relationship in light of observed data. The findings from Study 2 revealed that one of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to users being slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization without uncertainty information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and explores differences in belief update when the bivariate visualization is congruent or incongruent with users' prior belief.

Extending recent work applying Bayesian models to understand and evaluate belief updating from visualizations, we show how the predictions of Bayesian inference can be used to guide more rational belief updating. We design a Bayesian inference-assisted uncertainty analogy that numerically relates uncertainty in observed data to the user's subjective uncertainty, and a posterior visualization that prescribes how a user should update their beliefs given their prior beliefs and the observed data. In a pre-registered experiment on 4,800 people, we find that when a newly observed data sample is relatively small (N=158), both techniques reliably improve people's Bayesian updating on average compared to the current best practice of visualizing uncertainty in the observed data. For large data samples (N=5208), where people's updated beliefs tend to deviate more strongly from the prescriptions of a Bayesian model, we find evidence that the effectiveness of the two forms of Bayesian assistance may depend on people's proclivity toward trusting the source of the data.

In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions and various expressions of symptoms. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data (putting health in context). To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable of the use of social media data, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations.","Wonyoung So,Edyta Paulina Bogucka,Sanja Scepanovic,Sagar Joglekar,Ke Zhou,Daniele Quercia",f-info-1396,Humane Visual AI: Telling the stories behind a medical condition
f-info-1373,"Adapting dashboard design to different contexts of use is an open question in visualisation research. Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use, and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics, data models and users involved at different organizational levels. In this design study, we present QualDash, a dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI). We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of QualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals. Finally, we report evaluation results that demonstrate the adaptability, ease-of-use and usefulness of QualDash in a real-world scenario.","Mai Elshehaly,Rebecca Randell,Matthew Brehmer,Lynn McVey,Natasha Alvarado,Chris P.

f-scivis-1077,"We propose a visualization application, designed for the exploration of human spine simulation data. Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, {\color{blue} abstraction} and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. By linking the result data with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore, we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. In a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.","Pepe Eulzer,Sabine Bauer,Francis Kilian,Kai Lawonn",f-scivis-1077,Visualization of Human Spine Biomechanics for Spinal Surgery
f-vast-1184,"Pathogen outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks of bacteria and viruses) in hospitals can cause high mortality rates and increase costs for hospitals signiﬁcantly. An outbreak is generally noticed when the number of infected patients rises above an endemic level or the usual prevalence of a pathogen in a deﬁned population. Reconstructing transmission pathways back to the source of an outbreak – the patient zero or index patient – requires the analysis of microbiological data and patient contacts. This is often manually completed by infection control experts. We present a novel visual analytics approach to support the analysis of transmission pathways, patient contacts, progression of the outbreak, and patient timelines during hospitalization. Infection control experts applied our solution to a real outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a large German hospital. Using our system, our experts were able to scale the analysis of transmission pathways to longer time intervals (i.e., several years of data instead of days) and across a larger number of wards. Also, the system is able to reduce the analysis time from days to hours. In our ﬁnal study, feedback from twenty-ﬁve experts from seven German hospitals provides evidence that our solution brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts for analyzing outbreaks.","Tom Baumgartl,Markus Petzold,Marcel Wunderlich,Markus Höhn,Daniel Archambault,Michael Lieser,Alexander Dalpke,Simone Scheithauer,Michael Marschollek,Vanessa Eichel,Nico T.

One approach for disease progression modeling is to describe patient status using a small number of states that represent distinctive distributions over a set of observed measures. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and its variants are a class of models that both discover these states and make inferences of health states for patients. Despite the advantages of using the algorithms for discovering interesting patterns, it still remains challenging for medical experts to interpret model outputs, understand complex modeling parameters, and clinically make sense of the patterns. To tackle these problems, we conducted a design study with clinical scientists, statisticians, and visualization experts, with the goal to investigate disease progression pathways of chronic diseases, namely type 1 diabetes (T1D), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As a result, we introduce DPVis which seamlessly integrates model parameters and outcomes of HMMs into interpretable and interactive visualizations.

The resulting 3D models are based on a few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge available about the biological entity, represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new visual-programming technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop.

One widely applicable model for how humans understand data is descriptive rules, which can characterize important attributes and simultaneously their crucial values or ranges. In this paper, we introduce an approach to help with data understanding via interactively and automatically generated rules. Our approach makes discerning the behavior of groups of interesting data efficient and simple by bridging the gap between machine learning methods for rule learning and the user experience of sensemaking through visual exploration.

The method is model-agnostic and provides global explanation of the model behaviour.

In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for data visceralization.","Benjamin Lee,David Brown,Bongshin Lee,Christophe Hurter,Steven Drucker,Tim Dwyer",f-info-1084,Data Visceralization: Enabling Deeper Understanding of Data Using Virtual Reality
f-info-1177,"Design study is an established approach of conducting problem-driven visualization research. The academic visualization community has produced a large body of work reporting on design studies, informed by a handful of theoretical frameworks, and applied to a broad range of application areas. The result is an abundance of reported insights into visualization design, with an emphasis on novel visualization techniques and systems as the primary contribution of these studies. In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study. We offer this work as an example for implementing the rigor criteria to produce a diverse range of knowledge contributions.","Jen Rogers,Austin Patton,Luke Harmon,Alexander Lex,Miriah Meyer",f-info-1177,Insights From Experiments with Rigor in an EvoBio Design Study
f-info-1362,"A growing number of efforts aim to understand what people see when using a visualization. These efforts provide scientific grounding to complement design intuitions, leading to more effective visualization practice. However, published visualization research currently reflects a limited set of available methods for understanding how people process visualized data. Alternative methods from vision science offer a rich suite of tools for understanding visualizations, but no curated collection of these methods exists in either perception or visualization research. We introduce a design space of experimental methods for empirically investigating the perceptual processes involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms, adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science research, rooting each in visualization examples. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique. Researchers can use this design space to create innovative studies and progress scientific understanding of design choices and evaluations in visualization. We highlight a history of collaborative success between visualization and vision science research and advocate for a deeper relationship between the two fields that can elaborate on and extend the methodological design space for understanding visualization and vision.","Madison Elliott,Christine Nothelfer,Cindy Xiong,Danielle Szafir",f-info-1362,A Design Space of Vision Science Methods for Visualization Research
f-info-1208,"In the last two decades, interactive visualization and analysis have become a central tool in data-driven decision making. Concurrently to the contributions in data visualization, research in data management has produced technology that directly benefits interactive analysis. Here, we contribute a systematic review of 30 years of work in this adjacent field, and highlight techniques and principles we believe to be underappreciated in visualization work. We structure our review along two axes. First, we use task taxonomies from the visualization literature to structure the space of interactions in usual systems. Second, we created a categorization of data management work that strikes a balance between specificity and generality. Concretely, we contribute a characterization of 131 research papers along these two axes. We find that five notions in data management venues fit interactive visualization systems well: materialized views, approximate query processing, user modeling and query prediction, multi-query optimization, lineage techniques, and indexing techniques. In addition, we find a preponderance of work in materialized views and approximate query processing, most targeting a limited subset of the interaction tasks in the taxonomy we used. This suggests natural avenues of future research both in visualization and data management. Our categorization both changes how we visualization researchers design and build our systems, and highlights where future work is necessary.","Leilani Battle,Carlos Scheidegger",f-info-1208,A Structured Review of Data Management Technology for Interactive Visualization and Analysis
f-scivis-1120,"3D Lines are a widespread rendering primitive for the visualization of data from research fields like fluid dynamics or fiber tractography. Global illumination effects and transparent rendering improve the perception of three-dimensional features and decrease occlusion within the data set, thus enabling better understanding of complex line data. We present an efficient approach for high quality GPU-based rendering of line data with ambient occlusion and transparency effects. Our approach builds on GPU-based raycasting of rounded cones, which are geometric primitives similar to truncated cones, but with spherical endcaps. Object space ambient occlusion is provided by an efficient voxel cone tracing approach. Our core contribution is a new fragment visibility sorting strategy that allows for interactive visualization of line data sets with millions of line segments. We improve performance further by exploiting hierarchical opacity maps.","David Groß,Stefan Gumhold",f-scivis-1120,Advanced Rendering of Line Data with Ambient Occlusion and Transparency
f-tvcg-2019080294," This paper presents a comprehensive study of rendering techniques for 3D line sets with transparency. The rendering of transparent lines is widely used for visualizing trajectories of tracer particles in flow fields. Transparency is then used to fade out lines deemed unimportant, based on, for instance, geometric properties or attributes defined along with them. Accurate blending of transparent lines requires rendering the lines in back-to-front or front-to-back order, yet enforcing this order for space-filling 3D line sets with extremely high-depth complexity becomes challenging. In this paper, we study CPU and GPU rendering techniques for transparent 3D line sets. We compare accurate and approximate techniques using optimized implementations and several benchmark data sets. We discuss the effects of data size and transparency on quality, performance, and memory consumption. Based on our study, we propose two improvements to per-pixel fragment lists and multi-layer alpha blending. The first improves the rendering speed via an improved GPU sorting operation, and the second improves rendering quality via transparency-based bucketing.","Michael Kern,Christoph Neuhauser,Torben Maack,Mengjiao Han,Will Usher,Rüdiger Westermann",f-tvcg-2019080294,A Comparison of Rendering Techniques for 3D Line Sets with Transparency
f-tvcg-2019090310,"Dense ﬂow visualization is a popular visualization paradigm. Traditionally, the various models and methods in this area use a continuous formulation, resting upon the solid foundation of functional analysis. In this work, we examine a discrete formulation of dense ﬂow visualization. From probability theory, we derive a similarity matrix that measures the similarity between different points in the ﬂow domain, leading to the discovery of a whole new class of visualization models. Using this matrix, we propose a novel visualization approach consisting of the computation of spectral embeddings, i.e., characteristic domain maps, deﬁned by particle mixture probabilities. These embeddings are scalar ﬁelds that give insight into the mixing processes of the ﬂow on different scales. The approach of spectral embeddings is already well studied in image segmentation, and we see that spectral embeddings are connected to Fourier expansions and frequencies. We showcase the utility of our method using different 2D and 3D ﬂows. ","Daniel Preuß,Tino Weinkauf,Jens Krüger",f-tvcg-2019090310,A Discrete Probabilistic Approach to Dense Flow Visualization
f-scivis-1059,"Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (Structured AMR) enables simulations to adapt the domain resolution to save computation and storage, and has become one of the dominant data representations used by scientific simulations; however, efficiently rendering such data remains a challenge.  We present an efficient approach for volume- and iso-surface ray tracing of Structured AMR data on GPU-equipped workstations, using a combination of two different data structures. Together, these allow the ray tracing based renderer to quickly determine which segments along the ray need to be integrated at which frequency, while also providing quick access to all data values required for a smooth sample reconstruction kernel. Our method makes use of RTX ray tracing hardware for surface rendering, ray marching, space skipping, and adaptive sampling; and allows for interactive changes to the transfer function and implicit iso-surfacing thresholds.  We demonstrate that our method achieves high performance with little memory overhead, enabling interactive high quality rendering of complex AMR data sets on individual GPU workstations.","Ingo Wald,Stefan Zellmann,Will Usher,Nate Morrical,Ulrich Lang,Valerio Pascucci",f-scivis-1059,Ray Tracing Structured AMR Data Using ExaBricks
f-scivis-1132,"Computationally-demanding tasks are typically calculated in dedicated data centers and real-time visualizations follow this trend as well. Some rendering tasks, however, require highest-level of confidentiality so that no other party, besides the owner, can read or see the sensitive data. We present a direct volume rendering approach that performs volume rendering directly on encrypted volume data by using the homomorphic Paillier encryption algorithm. This keeps the volume data and rendered image uninterpretable for the rendering server. Our volume rendering pipeline introduces novel approaches for encrypted-data compositing, interpolation, opacity modulation as well as simple transfer function design, where each of these routines maintains the highest-level of privacy. We present performance and memory overhead analysis that is associated with our privacy-preserving scheme. Our approach is open and secure by design as opposed to secure through obscurity. The owner of the data only has to keep her secure key confidential to guarantee the privacy of her volume data and the rendered images. Our work is to our knowledge the first privacy-preserving remote volume-rendering approach which does not require trusting any involved server, even in case the server is compromised, no sensitive data will be leaked to a foreign party.","Sebastian Mazza,Daniel Patel,Ivan Viola",f-scivis-1132,Homomorphic-Encrypted Volume Rendering
f-scivis-1038,"In this paper, we present a novel data structure, called the Mixture Graph. This data structure allows us to compress, render, and query segmentation histograms. Such histograms arise when building a mipmap of a volume containing segmentation IDs. Each voxel in the histogram mipmap contains a convex combination (mixture) of segmentation IDs. Each mixture represents the distribution of IDs in the respective voxel's children. Our method factorizes these mixtures into a series of linear interpolations between exactly two segmentation IDs. The result is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are topologically ordered. Pruning replicate nodes in the tree followed by compression allows us to store the resulting data structure efficiently. During rendering, transfer functions are propagated from sources (leafs) through the DAG to allow for efficient, pre-filtered rendering at interactive frame rates. Assembly of histogram contributions across the footprint of a given volume allows us to efficiently query partial histograms, achieving up to 178x speed-up over naive parallelized range queries. Additionally, we apply the Mixture Graph to compute correctly pre-filtered volume lighting and to interactively explore segments based on shape, geometry, and orientation using multi-dimensional transfer functions.","Khaled Al-Thelaya,Marco Agus,Jens Schneider",f-scivis-1038,"The Mixture Graph - A Data Structure for Compressing, Rendering, and Querying Segmentation Histograms"
